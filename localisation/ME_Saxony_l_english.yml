 saxony_integrate_poland_title: "Integrate Poland"
 saxony_integrate_poland_desc: "The time has come. With our skilled manipulation of the nobility within Poland, playing them off against each other, inflaming conflicts and supplying backdoor deals and equipment to nobles believed to weak to intervene in the situation. At last the Polish nobility is depleted. The few remaining lynchpins within the country are all staunchly devoted to the idea of becoming powerful nobles within a much greater nation, and the remainder are too weak to oppose them. Now is finally the time to cease the existance of Poland as an subordinate nation to our own, and instead let the Province of Poland come to exist the great nation of Saxony."

 saxony_the_saxon_polish_union_title: "The Saxon Polish Union"
 saxony_the_saxon_polish_union_desc: "The Elective Monarchy of Poland is a marvellous concept. It allows the potential for the best possible ruler to rule the nation, while also securing foreign alliances. However it has one major failling. It has no legislative protection from the whims of the nobles that form the electors. As a rising power on their borders, many of the Polish Nobles holding lands along our border have subtley approached us to discuss matters of protection. With these votes, and a few more we may gain from diplomacy and bribes within the nation, it may be possible for us to turn the Polish Crown over to a member of our dynasty, and then, with the support of the border nobles, overturn the elective monarchy, leaving us the absolute rulers of Poland and Saxony."
 saxony_the_polish_prerogative_title: "The Polish Prerogative"
 saxony_the_polish_prerogative_desc: "Poland is now our subject, but their loyalty is yet to be won. The nobility on the borders with our direct holdings are all for the complete integration of Poland into our nation, subverted with promises of higher titles and the destruction or demotion of their rivals. Now is a time to allow the status quo to dvelop, and allow the opposing nobles to stabilise and acclimatise to their new positions, and perhaps, in time, they will realise that becoming part of Saxony, is a much better turn of events then they first realised."

 saxony_crown_above_church_desc: "Our lands lie in the North of Germany, far from the Italian peninsula, and yet over such a great distance, we are still expected to petition the pope for every matter of religious contention. Rome proclaims itself the final legal matter on all spiritual affairs, and yet their guidance never reaches as far as our lands. No longer. We shall turn away from Rome and it's uncaring leaders, and instead look to those who have shown time and again to believe in the good of the Saxon people, our rulers."

 saxony_union_of_auhausen_title: "Union of Auhausen"
 saxony_union_of_auhausen_desc: "The tensions within the empire are reaching their peak, armed conflict across Germany is looking more and more innevitable. If the people of the reformation are to survive the coming storm, they must have a strong leader. There is no better nation to take on this position, and ensure the right of the reformed faiths to exist, than our own."
 saxony_victory_in_the_league_war_title: "Victory in the League War"
 saxony_victory_in_the_league_war_desc: "The storm has hit. The thunder is the sound of cannons, firing across the continent, toppling walls and tearing down fortifications. The rain is the hail of bullets and arrows, filling the air with shrieks and watering the ground with enough blood to water the plants for decades. The Wind is the cries and lamentations of the women and children left without their menfolk, to fend to themselves while their worlds burn to the ground. And dark clouds loom ever on the horizon, the threat of infidels and heathens from beyond the continent, all waiting for the perfect oppertunity to strike, and shatter Europe irreparably. This war must end. And it is our duty to our people to ensure it is in our victory."

 saxony_eastward_expansion_title: "Eastward Expansion"
 saxony_eastward_expansion_desc: "The Baltic region of Europe was one of the last holdouts of Paganism in all of Europe. For centuries the people of the region withstood conversion and any attempts to take over the reason by force, and for the longest time, the rest of the christian world were forced to admit the Balkan people, as an unpleasent blemish on christian europe, but one that could be ignored. In the end, it was the Teutonic Knights who finally pacified the region, sweeping through Prussia and the rest of the Baltics ensuring the extermination or conversion of all who opposed them. As an ascendant power, from a newly arisen religion, it would be symbloic for us to reenact this grand crusade, and much like the knights, our first port of call shall be Prussia."

 saxony_conquer_lower_franconia_title: "Foothold in Bavaria"
 saxony_conquer_lower_franconia_desc: "Bavaria is a land who have treasured their independance and special responsibilities within the Empire. They are a powerful state within the Empire, who have always been able to keep pace with all the states around them, despite the more advantageous positions of those neighbouring rivals. It is a certainty that such adaptable people would find a great home within our fledgling German state, and that we have plenty of benefits that could come from them."
 saxony_the_road_to_germany_title: "The Road to Germany"
 saxony_the_road_to_germany_desc: "@GER §Y[GER.GetName]§! is on the Horizon. Our grand ambition is one of such scope that it seemed impossible to acheive from the first day, but our people pushed forwards regardless, perhaps naively, but with an optimism and drive that put to shame the entire world. Now we stand on the very precipice, only a single province remains outside our domain, and with it's acquisition we could legitimately identify ourselves as not Saxony, but Germany. Let the world know of the unity of the German people, let them hear the roar of a people who will no longer be divided, who will no longer allow foreign aggressors to turn them against each other and will instead stand taller than any other nation in the world."
 saxony_the_ninety_five_theses_title: "The Ninety Five Theses"
 saxony_the_ninety_five_theses_desc: "A preacher has come to some renown recently in [59.GetName]. He has over some time compiled a list of the misdeads of the Catholic church, and a thesis on what is fundamentally wrong with it's methodology. All of this he nailed to the door of the local church. Naturally the contents of these theses have rapidly been distributed throughout the local area and beyond. After a brief read, many of the major players within our country have confirmed the validity of their contents, and now push us to show support for this radical reformer. While open support may not yet be a wise decision, if we invest in the local area, and while doing so, perhaps implement a few of these changes in the way the area is run, we may be able to show our favour without incuring political opposition."

 saxony_a_throne_built_on_blood_title: "A Throne Built on Blood"
 saxony_a_throne_built_on_blood_desc: "The imperial seat is now ours. A [Root.Religion.GetName] emperor now reigns over all of Germany. But what was the cost? How many faithful died on the fields, so that we might sit atop this seat. How many people wil starve to death in the coming months because their are no men left to tend the fields, or because the fields themselves have been burned to the ground in the name of victory. It is our duty now to answer all of these questions, and provide a solution to each in turn. No embarrassment is too great, no humiliation not worth it so that our subjects might finally know peace, free from the persecution of the unenlightened. In my dreams, it is glorious. In my waking nightmares, everything is coated in blood."

 saxony_a_true_saxon_state_title: "A True Saxon State"
 saxony_a_true_saxon_state_desc: "While we hold the title of Saxony, and are therefore the nominal rulers of the Saxon people, the true saxon people occupy a vast swathe of German lands, much of which not just outside our own hands, but wthin the territories and fiefdoms of our sworn enemies. To be truly deserving of the title of Saxony, we must centralise the Saxon people under one nation. To precipitate this, we have created a grand plan. The first step, is to aquire the weak and defenseless lands of Anhalt to our north, while simultaneously striking eastwards into Bohemia. Too long have rightful god fearing Catholics laboured under the bootheels of those Hussite loving scum."

 saxony_conquer_upper_franconia_title: "Conquer Franconia"
 saxony_conquer_upper_franconia_desc: "The Franconian people are a very small portion of the people of Germany. They remain under the reign of a very few leaders, and refuse the rule of anyone not of Franconian descent. If we are to create a united German state, as is our ultimate goal, then we need to reach a compromise with these people that would allow us to properly integrate these people into our nation without the use of overly forcible methods. A people whose freedom is taken will always rise against their rulers at every oppertunity. A People who offer up their independance willingly will be much more ready to find their own place within a larger system."

Granted to them is the supreme authority with which to crown the Emperor of the faithful, the leader of the Most Holy empire on the planet. If we were to secure such a position, then no door within the empire would be closed to us."
 saxony_a_kingdom_within_title: "A Kingdom Within"
 saxony_a_kingdom_within_desc: "The title of King within the Empire is one of extreme prestige and is an incredible show faith from the Emperor. Only the Emperor himself may grant unto a catholic state within the empire the right to call itself a Kingdom, and once granted such a title may never be revoked. If we were able to aquire such a title, then no one in the Empire would be able to question our legitimacy as a true soverign state."
 saxony_saxon_imperial_ambitions_title: "Saxon Imperial Ambitions"
 saxony_saxon_imperial_ambitions_desc: "Our country is a great one. A home to brilliant minds who deserve respect far beyond what is paid to them. We must acquire a greater level of prestige within the Holy Roman Empire. We must prove our selves a viable nominee to the title of Emperor, and in doing so hopefully aquire the resources needed to reward the deserving already existing in our state."
