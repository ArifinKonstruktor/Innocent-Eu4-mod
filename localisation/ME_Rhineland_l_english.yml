 # Missions:
 RHN_The_New_Strengths_title: "The Rhenish Army"
 RHN_The_New_Strengths_desc: "We may have benign intent, but our neighbors do not seem to share our concerns with ethical and kind conquest. We must build an army for equal use in defense and attack."
 RHN_Stabilize_title: "Stabilize the State"
 RHN_Stabilize_desc: "We currently rule over an ethnically diverse set of Germans. While we do seem to be managing to keep the nation under control, we cannot ensure it stays this way forever. We should allocate resources to ensure the state it built up to be more stable."
 RHN_Unite_Rhineland_title: "Unite Rhineland"
 RHN_Unite_Rhineland_desc: "The conglomerate of territories we currently possess can hardly be called a united Rhineland. We need to fully control this region before we can truly hold justification to proclaim ourselves as such."
 RHN_Strengthen_the_reserves_title: "Strengthen the Reserves"
 RHN_Strengthen_the_reserves_desc: "While our army may be mighty, we must ensure we have enough soldiers to properly reinforce and possibly expand it. Without said manpower, we may cannot ensure the quelling of rebels nor national defense, thus it is imperative we address this immediately."
 RHN_franconia_title: "Conquer Franconia"
 RHN_franconia_desc: "While we proclaim that we are the nation of Rhineland, we were perhaps too hasty in our judgement. For instance, we have not yet seized control of the various neighboring territories that jointly inhabit the Rhine, posing a significant threat to our safety. Logically speaking, they should be our next target."
 RHN_switzerland_title: "The Mountain Land"

 RHN_rhine_south_desc: "While one of the sources of the Rhine lies in Franconia, we still need to follow the river south to truly claim the title of Rhineland. our glory and prestige shall be complete upon our complete strategic control. Owning this territory will also provide us with a unique opportunity for trade, as many merchants intent on entering the Atlantic make their way from the Upper Rhine."
 RHN_bavaria_title: "Take Over Bavaria"
 RHN_bavaria_desc: "The Baravian region presents both a threat and an opportunity. Their strength and power is a threat, but if incoroporated into our great nation, it could prove a decent manpower--and beer--source for exploitation. Thus to satisfy both the doctrines of defense and attack, we must invade."
 RHN_rhine_north_title: "Follow the Rhine North"
 RHN_rhine_north_desc: "The time is nigh to assert our dominance over trade in the region and truly become the Rhineland as we solidify control over the Rhine."
 RHN_rhenish_fleet_title: "The Rhenish Fleet"
 RHN_rhenish_fleet_desc: "Typically, we haven't much need of a fleet, but lately our mercantile interests have been threatened by nearby naval powers, such as those of Britain. We must start a naval buildup immediately to protect our interests and support future ventures."
 RHN_westphalia_title: "Conquer Westphalia"
 RHN_westphalia_desc: "Though we may already control some of Westphalia, it is best not to leave a people divided between two nations. As a mercy to their ethnicity, we must invade the rest of Westphalia and assert our control to reunite the self-imposed schism."
 RHN_weser_title: "Access to the North Sea"
 RHN_weser_desc: "The North Sea is rich in natural resources; it would be a shame to miss out on further mercantile ventures in the region. Our newfound naval power should be used to increase trade power in the region and incorporate more of the coastline."

 RHN_aachen_title: "Aachen Superioriy"
 RHN_aachen_desc: "Though Frankfurt is an integral part of our nation, we must focus on the superiority of Rhineland rather than some far-flung city. We must support Aachen's development in hopes it will one day surpass Frankfurt. Then we will know our task is complete."
 RHN_the_guard_on_rhine_title: "Die Wacht am Rhein"
 RHN_the_guard_on_rhine_desc: "The Rhine shall be the strongest fighting force in the world, but for now we must start with a simply a worthy adversary. The Franks should do."

 RHN_idea_1: "Feuerkorps"
 RHN_idea_1_desc: "The existence of a state is predicated on its ability to defend its sovereignty. To ensure this, the Kingdom of Rhineland must field an army to match its neighbors and dissuade any would-be invaders."
 
 RHN_idea_2: "Electoral Privilege"
 RHN_idea_2_desc: "As the State expands its territory, it should not neglect the significance of diplomatic missions; luckily, Rhineland's role as an Elector of the Holy Roman Empire gives it an influential standing amongst the other princes."
 
 RHN_idea_3: "Cologne War Academy"
 RHN_idea_3_desc: "The Cologne War Academy was established in 1578 in an attempt to not only improve the military institutions of Rhineland, but also to recruit foreign talent to serve within the country. Ambitious officers from Portugal to Poland have come to learn, and subsequently contribute to our own military tradition."
 
 RHN_idea_4: "The Writ of Inspection"
 RHN_idea_4_desc: "In 1610 Wolfgang the Good, King of Rhineland, caught wind of a noble plot - a plot which would have ended in relinquishing many powers of the monarchy. What followed was a veritable uprooting of the Rhenish bureaucracy; though harsh, the affair was bloodless which bought it the support of the remaining bureacrats. Wolfgang the Good passed the Writ of Inspection in 1611, a law which would vastly increase the transparency of political acts, and one which was upheld until the dissolution of Rhenish State."
 
 RHN_idea_5: "Rheinischer Landsknecht"
 RHN_idea_5_desc: "Rheinland has long been known for its mercenaries. Perhaps we can entice the local mercenary companies with promises of land in exchange for their services."
 
 RHN_idea_6: "Urbanized Network"

 RHN_idea_7: "Staatsinvestition"
 RHN_idea_7_desc: "Though the concept was first pioneered by the Italian City States, the practice of state bonds was later revived and popularized in the Rhineland during the late 17th century for its gradual industrialization process."

 ME_Rhenish_Events.2.d: "With the invention of Printing Press by Johannes Gutenberg in the middle of first century brought a true revolution to the daily life of Europeans. With Printing Press being embraced by cities throught Europe, books became accessible to the middle class allowing spread of new ideas to lower social layers. Now, with Printing Press embraced by our state, we are able to use this revolutionary technique to our advantage.
