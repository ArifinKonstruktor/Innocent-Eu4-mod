 RHN_ideas_bonus: "Rhenish Ambitions"
 
 RHN_idea_1: "Feuerkorps"
 RHN_idea_1_desc: "The existence of a state is predicated on its ability to defend its sovereignty. To ensure this, the Kingdom of Rhineland must field an army to match its neighbors and dissuade any would-be invaders."
 
 RHN_idea_2: "Electoral Privilege"
 RHN_idea_2_desc: "As the State expands its territory, it should not neglect the significance of diplomatic missions; luckily, Rhineland's role as an Elector of the Holy Roman Empire gives it an influential standing amongst the other princes."
 
 RHN_idea_3: "Cologne War Academy"
 RHN_idea_3_desc: "The Cologne War Academy was established in 1578 in an attempt to not only improve the military institutions of Rhineland, but also to recruit foreign talent to serve within the country. Ambitious officers from Portugal to Poland have come to learn, and subsequently contribute to our own military tradition."
 
 RHN_idea_4: "The Writ of Inspection"
 RHN_idea_4_desc: "In 1610 Wolfgang the Good, King of Rhineland, caught wind of a noble plot - a plot which would have ended in relinquishing many powers of the monarchy. What followed was a veritable uprooting of the Rhenish bureaucracy; though harsh, the affair was bloodless which bought it the support of the remaining bureacrats. Wolfgang the Good passed the Writ of Inspection in 1611, a law which would vastly increase the transparency of political acts, and one which was upheld until the dissolution of Rhenish State."
 
 RHN_idea_5: "Rheinischer Landsknecht"
 RHN_idea_5_desc: "Rheinland has long been known for its mercenaries. Perhaps we can entice the local mercenary companies with promises of land in exchange for their services."
 
 RHN_idea_6: "Urbanized Network"
 RHN_idea_6_desc: "The cities of the Rhine are some of the most developed in Germany. Improving the roads of that connect the cities to each other as well as encouraging inter-city trade have helped us become more and more economically independent."
 
 RHN_idea_7: "Staatsinvestition"
 RHN_idea_7_desc: "Though the concept was first pioneered by the Italian City States, the practice of state bonds was later revived and popularized in the Rhineland during the late 17th century for its gradual industrialization process."
