 # Events:
 ME_Lubeck_Events.1.t: "Elevating Bergen Kontor"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.1.d: "First Established as a Hanseatic center in 1350, Bergen has since grown into a fully fleged trade post, featuring wharfs, shopfronts, and all manner of warehouses. The location provides the League a strategic position to access the North Sea and White Sea markets; perhaps we should capitalize on this?"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.1.a: "Money is no issue!"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.1.b: "A risky investment..."
 ME_Lubeck_Events.1.c: "I'd rather not."
    
 ME_Lubeck_Events.2.t: "Hanseatic Investments"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.2.d: "The Hanseatic league has decided to invest some money to improving the trading infrastructure of Bergen. This may not quite be the blessing it sounds to be..."

 ME_Lubeck_Events.3.t: "Purchase of Steelyard"
 ME_Lubeck_Events.3.d: "English-Hanseatic relations have been fraught with conflict in recent years; English merchants and Hanseatic Merchants alike have shown their fair share of competition, especially amongst the lucrative wool and cloth trade. The tides seem to be turning, however, as recent events have weakened the English. We may finally be able to establish a foothold in the Isles, right in London itself!"
