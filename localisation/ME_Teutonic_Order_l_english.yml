 ME_Teutonic_Order_Events.1.d: "The bloody and disastrous battle of Grunwald sparked the decline of the holy Teutonic Order. A decline that would certainly lead to many empires' downfall. But not ours, for we are unlike other states. We are a state that can learn from prior mistakes and one that can improve. The holy establishment in the Baltics shall not only live to see another day, but also to deliver divine will in the north."

 ME_Teutonic_Order_Events.2.d: "The means of exchange are truly the Wealth of Nations. This especially affects us, for a significant portion of our income is based on the export of the valuable amber and the exclusive trading rights related to it. The trade within the cities forms the bulk of national income and it is only natural that we go out to great lengths to ensure the growth of commerce. In order to do that, we should reach out to the Hansa, with whom we have been cooperating for the past century, so as to negotiate a trade deal benefitting us both."

 ME_Teutonic_Order_Events.5.a: "By all means!"
 ME_Teutonic_Order_Events.5.b: "That island is their problem, not ours."
