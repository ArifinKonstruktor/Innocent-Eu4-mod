As the new overlords of France, we cannot allow their struggle to continue. Aiding the French will show their nobility that we are not the tyrants they believe, but custodians that will take care of their wealth better than they will."

 # Events:
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.1.t: "Discontent in Terra Gallica"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.1.d: "Ever since the beginning of the Hundred Years' War, the English possessions in France have been terrorized by the foreign populace which has the gall to claim that we have no right to rule these lands. Unsurprisingly, the French citizenry isn't satisfied with the terms of the Second Treaty of Tours and is now launching deadly attacks on the English Administration in the region. This obviously cannot stand, and therefore we must decide what to do with the vile scum on the mainland."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.1.a: "Send in the troops"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.1.b: "They can handle it themselves."
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.2.t: "The Reign of Edward IV"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.2.d: "Edward was an extremely capable and daring military commander. He crushed the opposing house during the War of the Roses in a series of spectacular victories. Domestically, Edward restored order and civility, cracked down on banditry and piracy. Edward was also an incredibly successful businessman and merchant, heavily investing in several corporations within the City of London."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.2.a: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is the rightful [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.2.b: "He will make a wonderful King"
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.t: "Evolution of the English Culture"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.1: "§GEnglish and French Culture remain unchanged§!. Alongside our union of monarch, our French and English holdings show little intermingling, resulting in a completely divided populace. Even within mostly shared cities, English residents typically settle in close proximity to other Englishmen, as with the French. As a result, cultural exchange seems foolhardy at best to think about."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.2: "§GOne may find traces of cultures blending§!. With the passing of time, so too passes intolerance and ignominy. The French, despite their bitter defeat, have started to acclimate to their new conditions, as have the English. As such occurs, diffusion also occurs, and one may observe several linguistic anomalies already in Normand, which we predict will make their way onto the English mainland in due time."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.3: "§GLanguages loaning words from each other becomes visible in daily life§!. Though a linguistically complex and redundant language, French, nevertheless, has begun to loan out words and phrases to its English counterpart, spurring the diffusion process. Instead of in pound sterling, Englishmen now purchase goods with livre."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.4: "§GFrench influence may be seen in the English Court§!. Though foreign influence is typically an unwanted occurrence, the influencers at hand mean us no harm. The French, through careful political maneuvers, have begun to influence our court. If it were any other nation, we would be up in arms, but seeing as the French have relinquished themselves to their rightful place at our side, we may rest easy."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.5: "§GLanguages start to borrow grammar from each other§!. Grammar between English and French, though similar in some ways, is resoundingly different in others. It would seem as though the aforementioned similarities have begun to shine through, as grammar from one language becomes substituted for the other's. Though this trend is worrying, we should sit by and see where it takes us."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.6: "§GEnglish idioms start to leak into French Language§!. Before, English idioms had forever been part of our identity, kept within our walls and held dearly. With the new turn of cultural diffusion, however, we have begun to see more and more Frenchmen use these phrases, practically robbed from us. Though unsettling, they do no harm, thus we cannot act."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.7: "§GSpeakers of English Accent can be seen in France and vice versa§!. English and French speaking diverged from a young age due to the English Channel presenting difficulties for intercommunication. That divergence has begun to mend as we bridge said channel, bringing both our peoples and our languages closer together. Even now, one may notice Englishmen speaking with a French accent and vice versa."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.8: "§GImpact of English language can be easily seen in the French Aristocratic Language§!. The language of the elite has always differed from the language of the peasantry. That being said, on a political scale, all of England is the aristocracy, and the French are the subjugated serfs. As such, many of our common terms can be easily seen in the French aristocracy's way of speaking, bringing us to believe they have recognized our language as fully superior."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.9: "§GEnglish Grammar heavily influenced by French§!. Grammar is an interesting issue to mull over, but in recent events, we are not sure which grammar to be using. With more and more linguistic culture arriving from France, our grammar is merely a husk of what it used to be."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.10: "§GEnglish is more comparable to Romance languages than to its Germanic cousins§!. We have noticed a trend. Not a positive one, nor a negative, but a trend nonetheless. Our newfound linguistic similarity with the French has blossomed into a beneficial relationship on mainland Europe, but our linguistic similarities with the Scotts have withered into nothingness. One can barely understand a Scotsman as an Englishman, and the converse is also true."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.a: "Okay."
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.5.t: "Location for the Grand Palace"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.5.d: "To further solidify the union, we shall build a grand palace blah blah blah. Time to pick a site for it."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.5.a: "London! London is the ideal site as it is the center of the Empire."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.5.b: "Famous city of Paris should do the job."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.5.c: "Let the lottery decide."
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.6.t: "Grand Palace Built"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.6.d: "Blah blah, it is built, amazing and stuff, but it can be expanded further!"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.6.a: "It shall be expanded and we'll pay for it!"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.6.b: "France shall pay for the expansion!"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.6.c: "We don't need no expansion."
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.7.t: "The Case for the Bretons"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.7.d: "The Bretons have different language and different customs from their neighbors in France nor they are similar to people in England. This of course poses a significant problem as they can become a thorn in our side."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.7.a: "PLACEHOLDER"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.7.b: "PLACEHOLDER"
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.13.t: "Royal Universities"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.13.d: "Although the University of Cambridge was given a royal charter in 1231, and similar privileges were given to Oxford in 1248, the universities still request further grants, likely due to the growing influence of French universities of the same ilk. We can, of course, satisfy these demands and give the English scholars extra support, but maintaining the current status quo may lead to greater acceptance of foreign schooling."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.13.a: "Grant additional privileges to English universities"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.13.b: "We should embrace education equally throughout our grand empire"
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.16.t: "End of the Italian Wars"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.16.d: "The Angevin claims over Italian holdings have spurred along a long, dreadfully deadly conflict that has taken its toll on our populace. Bereaved mothers, still weeping from the losses of their sons, suffer now more than ever, knowing the sacrifice their darling children made was all for naught. As the country's manpower dwindles beyond exhaustion, there are few to no men to work on the fields that were once sustaining our populace. The resulting famines kill thousands each day, likely due to the massive taxes we were forced to implement. As our enemies enforce substantial war reparations upon us, there is no way the state can afford to aid the people in these tumultuous times."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.16.a: "The state will take time to recover."
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.17.t: "Containment Breach"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.17.d: "Our enemies were not expecting our sudden victory over the French. For centuries, next generations of foreign powers worked together to keep the balance of power in check and not to let our state get too dominant. But with the English lineage secured on the French throne, this ancient balance of power has been destroyed and our foes are looking into creating a coalition that will end our dominance in France."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.17.a: "En Garde!"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.17.b: "Send out spies to sabotage their actions!"
