 UKS_Integrate_French_Concessions_title: "Integrate the Concessions"
 UKS_Integrate_French_Concessions_desc: "We are the victor of this grand conflict, and thus the spoils are ours. The growth of unity between our peoples must be taken in strides, the first among which is the integration of such a prize. If we are foster such a relation with the French, we must see to these matters personally."
 UKS_recover_england_title: "The English Recovery"
 UKS_recover_england_desc: ""
 UKS_loyalty_of_france_title: "Favour of the French"
 UKS_loyalty_of_france_desc: "A subject that resents their monarch is not a subject at all, but rather a revolt in the making. A philosopher in Italy by the name of Machiavelli has recently published works regarding earning the favor of one's subjects. We should rule in equal parts benevolent and mercilessly."
 UKS_recover_france_title: "Aid France"
 UKS_recover_france_desc: "The war has taken its toll on both sides. While we have managed to recover from the dreadful conflict, the French lie exhausted and bereaved, caught up in the horrors of war. As the new overlords of France, we cannot allow their struggle to continue. Aiding the French will show their nobility that we are not the tyrants they believe, but custodians that will take care of their wealth better than they will."
 UKS_the_isles_title: "Terra Britannica"
 UKS_the_isles_desc: "We cannot focus our full attention to continental affairs whilst the Scots and Irish pose a constant threat. Perhaps it is time to bring the Isles fully under English control, once and for all."
 UKS_cultures_of_France_title: "French Civilization"
 UKS_cultures_of_France_desc: "Contrary to the status of oxymoron, French civilization is both rather advanced, and relatively civilized compared to the barbaric traditions of their neighbors. In all fairness, there are far worse fates than accepting the French as our own."
 UKS_bromance_title: "Friendship"
 UKS_bromance_desc: "Perhaps the Franks are naught but our natural allies, contrary to our prior assumptions. They oppose us to some extent, but only in all fairness. Perhaps we should attempt a more diplomatic approach to the Frankish question."
 UKS_develop_france_title: "Develop France"
 UKS_develop_france_desc: "If we are to foster a positive relationship with the Franks, we should prove we have their best interests at heart. A kind hand would do the job."
 UKS_develop_french_lands_title: "Religious Cohesion"
 UKS_develop_french_lands_desc: "Our future plans require a healthy relationship with France. Hundreds of years of rivalry have damaged our ties severely, yet we seem to have been able to repair this prolonged tear. Before finally solidifying the union, we must ensure that the final step, religious unity, is achieved."
 UKS_our_possessions_title: "English Possessions"
 UKS_our_possessions_desc: "The French are our people now to do with what we please. With their spirit tempered to suit our needs, we need but utilize such an attitude. Potential piques the brim of France, of which we needn't shun, but embrace for the gain of all."
 UKS_quell_down_title: "Quell the Rebellions"
 UKS_quell_down_desc: "It would seem as though the pride of France goes unhindered. In fact, our recent actions have done naught but spur and kindle the flames of French nationalism and resistance. Such notions are dangerous and should be treated with care. Our rightfully claimed lands rise, thus we must lower them."
 UKS_Palace_title: "The Great Palace"
 UKS_Palace_desc: "Both the French and English know great amounts regarding architecture. We ourselves host great feats of engineering, mostly hosted from London, but the French provide a more elegant touch to a hardy style, stemming from the gothic constructions originating there. If we were to combine such machinations of man, we might construct a palace worthy of our dual monarchy. Such an action may pay tribute to the insurmountable ego of the Franks, perhaps bringing forth greater cooperation and, perhaps, temper the grand rebellions that undoubtedly brew."
 UKS_brittany_title: "Conquer Brittany"
 UKS_brittany_desc: "These vile and traitorous Britons thought they could escape our wrath, guarded by naught but water. As our sphere of influence grows, Brittany refuses to yield, thus they must be met with the force they undoubtedly plan to give."
 UKS_anjou_title: "Origin of D'Anjou"
 UKS_anjou_desc: "Our grand empire of Angevin stems from the ideas of Anjou, the supposed seat of such an empire. As this idea comes to fruition, they shall gladly join the nation we toiled tirelessly to create."
 UKS_extend_possessions_title: "Expand Terra Gallica"
 UKS_extend_possessions_desc: "The French lands of mainland Europe did not lie solely under Valois rule. The House of Bourgogne, among several others, controlled substantial French lands, some of which have not made their way into our grasp. We need to reclaim these lands that are rightfully ours."
 UKS_Provence_title: "Provencal Menace"
 UKS_Provence_desc: "Provence poses as the natural ally of France, yet opposes our legitimacy as their monarch. Their hypocrisy is a stain on our reputation, which cannot go unpunished. Their unique position near Genoa will help to supplement our income, while at the same time bolstering ourselves as the true France as well as England."
 UKS_Burgundy_title: "Duchy of Burgundy"
 UKS_Burgundy_desc: "The Burgundians have tested our patience for long enough. We cannot allow another to claim the mantle of France, for we are their monarch. All French lands shall be incorporated into our realm."
 UKS_Lorraine_title: "Conquer Lorraine"
 UKS_Lorraine_desc: "Among the last Valois strongholds, the lands of Lorraine and Barrois oppose us at every turn, going as far as claiming our throne. We cannot allow these insults to stand, thus we shall claim the industrial might of Lorraine as our own, bringing France all but completely under our control."
 UKS_Savoyard_title: "Take Savoie"
 UKS_Savoyard_desc: "The ancient French claims in Savoie would prove invaluable for further expeditions into Italy. We cannot pass up such an opportunity."
 UKS_Flanders_title: "Prospering Coast"
 UKS_Flanders_desc: "The European Coastline hosts numerous merchant societies such as those of Holland. Such mercantile establishments present both threats and opportunities for the expansion of our commerce. If left to their own devices, they might outcompete our noble merchants. On the other hand, such people would provide for decent sources of income under our control."
 UKS_low_countries_title: "The Low Countries"
 UKS_low_countries_desc: "The Bourgogne menace, though hindered, it not fully defeated. Remnants of their vast realm remain in the Netherlands and Low Countries, each refusing to support our claim to the French throne and raiding our nearby settlements. Such tactics are those of a coward, thus they will be treated as such."
 UKS_union_title: "Acts of Union"
 UKS_union_desc: "Until now, we haven't a true union with the Franks. We claim to be their monarch, yet we are two separate kingdoms, rather than a single empire. This must change; our peoples must become one."

 # Events:
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.1.t: "Discontent in Terra Gallica"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.1.d: "Ever since the beginning of the Hundred Years' War, the English possessions in France have been terrorized by the foreign populace which has the gall to claim that we have no right to rule these lands. Unsurprisingly, the French citizenry isn't satisfied with the terms of the Second Treaty of Tours and is now launching deadly attacks on the English Administration in the region. This obviously cannot stand, and therefore we must decide what to do with the vile scum on the mainland."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.1.a: "Send in the troops"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.1.b: "They can handle it themselves."
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.2.t: "The Reign of Edward IV"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.2.d: "Edward was an extremely capable and daring military commander. He crushed the opposing house during the War of the Roses in a series of spectacular victories. Domestically, Edward restored order and civility, cracked down on banditry and piracy. Edward was also an incredibly successful businessman and merchant, heavily investing in several corporations within the City of London."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.2.a: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is the rightful [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.2.b: "He will make a wonderful King"
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.t: "Evolution of the English Culture"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.1: "§GEnglish and French Culture remain unchanged§!. Alongside our union of monarch, our French and English holdings show little intermingling, resulting in a completely divided populace. Even within mostly shared cities, English residents typically settle in close proximity to other Englishmen, as with the French. As a result, cultural exchange seems foolhardy at best to think about."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.2: "§GOne may find traces of cultures blending§!. With the passing of time, so too passes intolerance and ignominy. The French, despite their bitter defeat, have started to acclimate to their new conditions, as have the English. As such occurs, diffusion also occurs, and one may observe several linguistic anomalies already in Normand, which we predict will make their way onto the English mainland in due time."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.3: "§GLanguages loaning words from each other becomes visible in daily life§!. Though a linguistically complex and redundant language, French, nevertheless, has begun to loan out words and phrases to its English counterpart, spurring the diffusion process. Instead of in pound sterling, Englishmen now purchase goods with livre."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.4: "§GFrench influence may be seen in the English Court§!. Though foreign influence is typically an unwanted occurrence, the influencers at hand mean us no harm. The French, through careful political maneuvers, have begun to influence our court. If it were any other nation, we would be up in arms, but seeing as the French have relinquished themselves to their rightful place at our side, we may rest easy."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.5: "§GLanguages start to borrow grammar from each other§!. Grammar between English and French, though similar in some ways, is resoundingly different in others. It would seem as though the aforementioned similarities have begun to shine through, as grammar from one language becomes substituted for the other's. Though this trend is worrying, we should sit by and see where it takes us."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.6: "§GEnglish idioms start to leak into French Language§!. Before, English idioms had forever been part of our identity, kept within our walls and held dearly. With the new turn of cultural diffusion, however, we have begun to see more and more Frenchmen use these phrases, practically robbed from us. Though unsettling, they do no harm, thus we cannot act."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.7: "§GSpeakers of English Accent can be seen in France and vice versa§!. English and French speaking diverged from a young age due to the English Channel presenting difficulties for intercommunication. That divergence has begun to mend as we bridge said channel, bringing both our peoples and our languages closer together. Even now, one may notice Englishmen speaking with a French accent and vice versa."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.8: "§GImpact of English language can be easily seen in the French Aristocratic Language§!. The language of the elite has always differed from the language of the peasantry. That being said, on a political scale, all of England is the aristocracy, and the French are the subjugated serfs. As such, many of our common terms can be easily seen in the French aristocracy's way of speaking, bringing us to believe they have recognized our language as fully superior."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.9: "§GEnglish Grammar heavily influenced by French§!. Grammar is an interesting issue to mull over, but in recent events, we are not sure which grammar to be using. With more and more linguistic culture arriving from France, our grammar is merely a husk of what it used to be."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.d.10: "§GEnglish is more comparable to Romance languages than to its Germanic cousins§!. We have noticed a trend. Not a positive one, nor a negative, but a trend nonetheless. Our newfound linguistic similarity with the French has blossomed into a beneficial relationship on mainland Europe, but our linguistic similarities with the Scotts have withered into nothingness. One can barely understand a Scotsman as an Englishman, and the converse is also true."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.3.a: "Okay."
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.5.t: "Location for the Grand Palace"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.5.d: "To further solidify the union, we shall build a grand palace blah blah blah. Time to pick a site for it."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.5.a: "London! London is the ideal site as it is the center of the Empire."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.5.b: "Famous city of Paris should do the job."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.5.c: "Let the lottery decide."
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.6.t: "Grand Palace Built"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.6.d: "Blah blah, it is built, amazing and stuff, but it can be expanded further!"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.6.a: "It shall be expanded and we'll pay for it!"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.6.b: "France shall pay for the expansion!"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.6.c: "We don't need no expansion."
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.7.t: "The Case for the Bretons"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.7.d: "The Bretons have different language and different customs from their neighbors in France nor they are similar to people in England. This of course poses a significant problem as they can become a thorn in our side."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.7.a: "PLACEHOLDER"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.7.b: "PLACEHOLDER"
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.13.t: "Royal Universities"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.13.d: "Although the University of Cambridge was given a royal charter in 1231, and similar privileges were given to Oxford in 1248, the universities still request further grants, likely due to the growing influence of French universities of the same ilk. We can, of course, satisfy these demands and give the English scholars extra support, but maintaining the current status quo may lead to greater acceptance of foreign schooling."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.13.a: "Grant additional privileges to English universities"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.13.b: "We should embrace education equally throughout our grand empire"
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.16.t: "End of the Italian Wars"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.16.d: "The Angevin claims over Italian holdings have spurred along a long, dreadfully deadly conflict that has taken its toll on our populace. Bereaved mothers, still weeping from the losses of their sons, suffer now more than ever, knowing the sacrifice their darling children made was all for naught. As the country's manpower dwindles beyond exhaustion, there are few to no men to work on the fields that were once sustaining our populace. The resulting famines kill thousands each day, likely due to the massive taxes we were forced to implement. As our enemies enforce substantial war reparations upon us, there is no way the state can afford to aid the people in these tumultuous times."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.16.a: "The state will take time to recover."
 
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.17.t: "Containment Breach"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.17.d: "Our enemies were not expecting our sudden victory over the French. For centuries, next generations of foreign powers worked together to keep the balance of power in check and not to let our state get too dominant. But with the English lineage secured on the French throne, this ancient balance of power has been destroyed and our foes are looking into creating a coalition that will end our dominance in France."
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.17.a: "En Garde!"
 ME_United_Kingdoms_Events.17.b: "Send out spies to sabotage their actions!"
