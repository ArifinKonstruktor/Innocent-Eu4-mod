 tamil_the_maldives_title: "Tamil Islands"
 tamil_the_maldives_desc: "The islands to our south, the Maldives, are inhabited by relatives of ours, the Malayalam, but they are much more distant compared to those of Kerala. They have begun to develop separate customs entirely devoid of Tamil or traditional Malayalam influence and Muslims are the dominant class there. In order to further our own interests and to rein in our increasingly distant brothers and sisters, we must take the Maldives for ourselves. From there, we can look outward to new horizons and also begin investing in staunchly Tamil and Malayalm Hindu guilds and merchants."
 tamil_mysore_to_kanara_title: "The Southern Deccan"
 tamil_mysore_to_kanara_desc: "Our entrance into the Deccan will be rough and hostile, that is a truth we will have to live with. But with the fire of war tempering our resolve and hardening us to the likes of gunpowder warfare and tactics of the current age, we will be able to adapt and overcome what opposition is laid out before us. Mysore and the coasts of Kanara are viable places of expansion for the Tamil people, but the dynastic powers currently present may very well push us to our limit. Be careful out there."
 tamil_kin_in_ceylon_title: "Our Kin in Lanka"
 tamil_kin_in_ceylon_desc: "The Kingdom of Jaffna, the righteous Tamil kingdom with a cruel foundational ruler, is our the only Tamil remnant left on the island of Lanka that is not subject to Sinhalese authority. Whilst the Sinhalese are alright trading partners, the island of Lanka has always been rightfully Tamil and should have been taken by our ancestors long ago. We will finish what they started and destroy Sinhalese power in order to establish the island as a haven and hub for Tamil people exclusively."
 tamil_the_heart_of_vijaya_title: "The Heart of Victory"
 tamil_the_heart_of_vijaya_desc: "The great successor to the Hoysala Empire, the Vijayanagar Empire, has towered over us for many decades. Their power was once thought to be unbreakable and untouchable, but they have shown great weakness as of late. That golden luster that shined from their City of Victory is now becoming dull, fading from its peak in the previous years and becoming ripe for conquest. That crowning achievement of seizing the City of Victory should belong to the Tamils, not the Muslims of the north, and after we take it, we can decide the fate of the once great city."
 tamil_north_carnatic_seizure_title: "The Carnatic Region"
 tamil_north_carnatic_seizure_desc: "The southeast coast of India has been the homeland of the Tamils since ages ago and many people know this, from the Oriya in the north and the Marathi to the west, but still the Carnatic region, integral to our homeland, lies in pieces. Dynasties and kingdoms think that the region can be divided up as they please, thinking the Tamil people don't care what they do it, but they are sorely mistaken. Now that the Tamils are united and together once again, we will see to it that the Carnatic region is whole once more." 
 tamil_south_indian_trade_title: "Tamil Investiture"
 tamil_south_indian_trade_desc: "Tamil trade guilds are some of the more lucrative and profitable guilds in all of India! Few if any can compare to the investments and profit they earn over time what with business coming from both east and west at consistent yearly rates. If we can protect their trade routes on the open water and give them certain land rights that they were not allowed before under different dynasties, then we can ensure the loyalty, respect, and even some income from the trade guilds."
 tamil_build_up_kanara_title: "Wealth in the West"
 tamil_build_up_kanara_desc: "Just north of the Kerala area are the coastal cities of Kanara. Lying in the southern end of the Deccan though not completely in tropical jungle, these coastal cities are some of the finest in Southern India and would do well as trade centers for us. Building them up with proper infrastructure and ensuring Tamilakam administrators are watching over the cities of Kanara will bolster not only the potential of the cities in Kanara, but it will also attract new scholars and high-minded individuals from western lands."
 tamil_beginning_tamil_industry_title: "Textiles of the Tamils"
 tamil_beginning_tamil_industry_desc: "Though we are still very much agrarian and mercantile in terms of what our population does for a living, textiles and the refinement of cloth and silk into finer designs is becoming an ever more lucrative industry for us. People from far off lands and also within our own diplomatic neighborhood are becoming more and more attracted to beautifully colored garments produced by various weavers in our lands, so why should we not provide for them? Getting a firm start on textile production now can only serve to cement a prosperous future for us."
 UNLOCK_OPTION_AT_BIDAR: "§GUnlocks a beneficial option upon the capture of the Bidar.§"
 tamil_march_on_bidar_title: "Center of the Deccan"
 tamil_march_on_bidar_desc: "The powerful remnant of the Delhi Sultanate in the Deccan is the Bahmani Sultanate. Though times are changing, the presence of an independent Muslim state in the Deccan is a threat to Tamilakam as a whole. We need to seek out the end of Muslim domination in the Deccan one way or another and taking the prized city of Bidar is one way in which we can start down this path."
 tamil_toward_arabia_title: "Settle Trade Disputes"
 tamil_toward_arabia_desc: "Arabia, long has it been a willing trade partner to the coastal people of our subcontinent as it provided horses, incense, and other resources in exchange for spices, gems, and other goods from our homeland. This trade has ensured good profit for Tamilakam, but it just is not enough, especially after Arabian merchants have been scorning our seizing of the Maldives. The path for us is simple now: we will take control of the trade routes from Arabia for ourselves by force."
 tamil_horn_landing_title: "Not Good Enough"
 tamil_horn_landing_desc: "Long have Somali merchants been some of the greatest sailors and greatest merchants of the vast ocean that surrounds our subcontinent. They come to our land, do good business, and then go home during the seasonal monsoons that blow through the vast open expanses of water. This trade is rather lucrative, is it not? Tamilakam makes decent profits from Somali merchants, but we are seeing more and more flaws in the trade practices of the Somalis that can be mended if they simply were under our instruction and guidance. Perhaps it is time we make our presence truly known in their homeland."
 tamil_western_deccan_title: "Strike at the Marathi"
 tamil_western_deccan_desc: "The Marathi in the western part of the Deccan are fierce and influential in many courts. Though the Tamil people have had little contact with them previously due to the Kannada people coming between us, but now that we are on the path to greatness, the Marathi are only a piece in our grand plan. Let us ride forth and smite down any semblance of power they might have!"
 tamil_telugu_taming_title: "The Telugu Wars"
 tamil_telugu_taming_desc: "North of the homeland of the Tamils is the homeland of the Telugus. Like us, the Telugu people have their own history they look up upon with pride, especially their last great dynasty that was destroyed by the Delhi Sultanate, that which was the Kakatiya Dynasty. The Telugu people are in disarray still but they pose an active threat to our ambitions should they ever become united. We must move quickly and put an end to these skirmishes and conflicts before things spiral out of our control."
 tamil_chola_military_part_one_title: "The Chola Template"
 tamil_chola_military_part_one_desc: "When it was at its height, the Chola military was well organized and administratered. Though gunpowder was not around for them, they had a Chariot Corps, Elephant Corps, Cavalry Corps, Infanty Corps, Medical Corps, and an Auxiliary Corps. This organization on the surface along with regularly paid kaikolars (a caste in Tamil society) and other aspects of the Chola military allowed it to become a truly grand force for the subcontinent. Perhaps we can use this model of military that the Cholas had to our advantage? Modernize it to our own standards with gunpowder weapons?"
 tamil_chola_military_part_two_title: "All Under the Maharaja"
 tamil_chola_military_part_two_desc: "The organization and administration of the Chola military focused on the ancient tradition of Chaturangabala for the former, and Sadangabala for the latter. The regiments of the Chola military were somewhat autonomous and they were free to endow their own selves with small temples (and the income they provided), but their organization was still controlled by the king and the administration in the form of multiple Senais (what can be described as regiments within a single army); it was from here a Senai was divided into various Corps. We have much to learn from this time period and there is room to refine the system to a modern form. Tamilakam will need a refined and formal military like the Cholas had in order to properly defend itself."
 tamil_chola_navy_part_one_title: "Rajaraja I's Legacy"
 tamil_chola_navy_part_one_desc: "In the time of Rajaraja I, the Cholas grew from being a small force in the southeast to being a grand empire the likes of which few if any of the time could imagine. His efforts to reform the Chola military and navy were successful, so much so that he launched expeditions even toward the Malay Peninsula in the east. If we are to be as great as Rajaraja I in the future, we will need to pursue a consistent build up of our navy through new ship designs, functional docks and shipyards, and also through attracting captains and admirals who are well versed in naval matters."
 tamil_chola_navy_part_two_title: "Tamil Power Projection"
 tamil_chola_navy_part_two_desc: "Our initial steps at reforming our fleet of ships has proved succesful! We have a great amount of sailors at the ready and admirals and captains ready to lead our ships into battle, or off into new trade regions. Let us never take a moment of rest in refining our naval capabilities and be like our ancestors of the Chola dynasty, projecting our power ever further outward and toward new domains!"
 tamil_orissas_old_domain_title: "Overtake Orissa"
 tamil_orissas_old_domain_desc: "There is lucrative trade to be had along the coasts of what the Gajapati Kingdom (Orissa) held, but the domain of the Gajapati Kingdom was not limited to the coast. The inland tribes, those of the Gonds, the Garjats, and the Jharkhandi were subjugated by Kapilendra Deva, but has their power stayed all throughout this time? We will only find out when we take them on for hegemony of the profitable eastern coasts and the strategically valuable inland villages and towns."
 tamil_clean_up_bahmanis_title: "Petty Khans and Sultans"
 tamil_clean_up_bahmanis_desc: "The collapse of Muslim authority coming from Bidar has shaken up politics just to the north. There are some who think that because the Tamils of Tamilakam have effectively destroyed the Sultanate of Bahmanis, they can proclaim independence and grow in power, but they are mistaken. We will not have such petty threats to our authority on our border to the north, they must be subjugated by us without hesitation!"
 tamil_taking_gujarat_title: "Revoke Gujarati Power"
 tamil_taking_gujarat_desc: "Trade rights throught the western waters is valuable and often times various states skirmish with each other for more lucrative trading rights. Those of Gujarat have naturally held a great deal of trade rights since the 'Hajj Port' grants the region a great deal of commerce and immigrants. For too long have we let the Gujarati people stay in the dominant trade position they are in; now we must rectify things and forcibly revoke their power."
 tamil_indus_estuary_power_title: "Seize the Indus Estuary"
 tamil_indus_estuary_power_desc: "The last bastion on the subcontinent's western side that remains out of our control is that of the Indus River's estuary. It may not be as lucrative as the Hajj Port once controlled by the sultans of Gujarat, but it is useful as a port of trade and for our ships. From there, we can extend our trading capacity westward toward the coasts of Hormuz, Basra, and many other places that have goods we most certainly want to have. Conducting this successfully will make us a truly unmatched power in all of India."
 tamil_vindhyan_campaign_title: "Operation: Vikramaditya"
 tamil_vindhyan_campaign_desc: "Ujjain, one of the holiest cities to Hindus across the subcontinent and plundered by the Delhi Sultanate in the early 1200s; the once glorious capital of the legendary emperor Vikramaditya was sacked and burned without remorse. The destroying of the temples in Ujjain and the subsequent rise of Muslim power in and around Ujjain has been a cause for pain for many faithful Hindu people, but the Tamils are on the verge of restoring it to its former glory. We have the power to dethrone any would-be sultan or nawab throughout the subcontinent, so let us use this power to push north toward Ujjain and ever closer to the heart of where these Muslims conquests stemmed from in the past."
 tamil_commanding_bengali_trade_title: "The Pride of Bengal"
 tamil_commanding_bengali_trade_desc: "Bengal was once the home of the mighty Pala Empire, the last great Buddhist empire on the subcontinent. Now it houses sultans and rajas alike, all who think they deserve control of the immensely valuable Bengal Delta. They may fight it out for decades, but Tamils know that they are just bickering over primitive trade practices and broken deals; only we know how to truly obtain the most of trade in such a valuable region. In order to get to that point though, we do need to subdue and take over the lands of the Bengali region, which is easier said than done."
 tamil_final_rush_title: "The Heart of Darkness"
 tamil_final_rush_desc: "Long have Hindus suffered because of what was cultivated in the city of Delhi. From the conquests in the late 1100s by ambitious Muslims just past the Khyber Pass in the northwest, Delhi has played a foundational role in setting up Muslim authority all across parts of the subcontinent. That power has reached as far as Gujarati ports and Bengali shores, Deccani towns and even Tamil grounds. The southernmost victims of these conquests and raids, however, are now back and ready to banish the great darkness that has been spilling out without end from Delhi. No longer will there be a sultan of Delhi to threaten Hindus across the subcontinent."
 tamil_rajput_land_title: "North vs. South"
 tamil_rajput_land_desc: "With our position in Gujarat secured, the threats in Rajputana are something we need to take seriously. The centers of power at Chittor and a few others places are what our main goals should be initially, but if we wish for a lasting peace to be made in the land, we must understand their martial heritage on a deeper level. If we can do this and display our own martial skills to the rajputs confidently, we will be able to integrate them much more easily."
 tamil_eastern_bengali_trade_title: "Buddhist Trade Wars"
 tamil_eastern_bengali_trade_desc: "Past the lucrative shores of the Bengal Delta are the tropical shores of the Burmese and their kin. We are somewhat familiar with them, but not nearly as much as the Benagli merchants and people are since there have been multiple trade disputes over the decades. Buddhist powers struggled against the sultans of Bengal in the past, but now that Hindus rightfully control the Bengali region once again, we can bring an end to these Buddhist incursions and slowly begin to reforge the eastern conquests done by the Chola dynasty centuries in the past."
 tamil_somali_extension_title: "Seize the Somali Markets"
 tamil_somali_extension_desc: "Our initial incursion into the Somali trade sphere has been successful so far, but we're lacking in support in many coastal cities. Somali merchants and local leaders are working toward expelling Tamil merchants and ships from their harbors, but we're going to make sure that our people stay right where they are. Somali markets are lucrative to the point of many people wanting them subdued for their own purposes; we'd be foolish to let them slip out of our hands."
 tamil_control_south_arabia_title: "Willing Trade Partners"
 tamil_control_south_arabia_desc: "Divisions in South Arabian communities has led to us being able to make a firm landing, but we the valuable markets along the southern coast that trade in various types of incense and crops should be enough of a reason for Tamil sailors and soldiers to be vying for more land. If we can secure the whole of South Arabia and start controlling the productive parts of the arid landscape, money will hardly be a problem for us in the future."
 tamil_reestablish_sangams_title: "The Tamil Sangams"
 tamil_reestablish_sangams_desc: "Long ago, the Tamil legends thrived as if they were the gods and goddesses conversing and living alongside people like ourselves. The First, Second, and Third Sangams, the effective progenitors and starters of Tamil literature, are among these Tamil legends, but the Third Sangam is more than just a legend; it was real! From all over the lands of the Tamils, poets and scholars alike gathered in what we know of as Madurai to work on literature and texts for future generations and readers. Perhaps now that we have united the Tamils as a whole, we can see a rebirth of this hallowed tradition?"
 tamil_sumatra_and_kedah_title: "Footsteps of the Cholas"
 tamil_sumatra_and_kedah_desc: "The echoes of the past are heard more loudly than ever now. With our incursions eastward toward the Malay Peninsula and toward the Strait of Malacca, we are truly following in the footsteps of the Chola Empire and what miraculous conquests the Chola dynasty carried out. From Rajaraja I in the late 900s to Kulothunga I in the late 1000s, we must continue down this path of retracing the conquests of old and securing the old domains of the Chola Empire under one administration. Our next targets? Kedah and Northern Sumatra."
 tamil_lower_burma_title: "Lower Burma's Value"
 tamil_lower_burma_desc: "The mouth of the Irrawaddy River in Lower Burma is a haven for both crop growth and trade ports. Indian people of various families and regions have long since been around Lower Burma for mercantile purposes, but not only this, they've been around Lower Burma for conquest too. The Chola dynasty's legacy of conquest is strong within Tamilakam and we will be taking what is rightfully belonging to not only Tamils, but for Indians as a whole. From there, the entirety of the Burmese region will be opened up to us for trade, or for conquest."
 tamil_tropical_subjects_title: "Let the Spice Flow"
 tamil_tropical_subjects_desc: "The waters of South East Asia are fertile with monsoons and spices. Whilst we can predict when and where monsoons will strike usually, we cannot predict how the political entities of these various islands will act toward us as our influence grows toward them. It would be in our best interest to make subjects out of these far-flung states before taking on the lands they reside on in full."
 tamil_malaccan_power_title: "Strait Combat"
 tamil_malaccan_power_desc: "The battles for the Strait of Malacca are always fierce since everyone involved knows what is at stake: trade rights and potentially, trade hegemony. The Chola Empire of the past knew this as well and contested heavily for the strait, just as we will with the might of our grand fleet and the thunderous march of our seasoned soldiers."
 tamil_the_last_stop_title: "The Final Frontier"
 tamil_the_last_stop_desc: "Legends tell of the Chola Empire sending forth an officer toward the east, a man named Sri Lumay. He did nto follow as was ordered and instead rebelled from the Chola Empire altogether, founding his own Rajahnate of Cebu. His small political entity, however, has seen tumultuous times as the archipelago he set up shop in is quite chaotic and unorganized. It is time we conquer this last frontier that the Chola Empire almost reached before retracting in reach; it is time to finish this fight."
 tamil_re_indianization_title: "Indianization"
 tamil_re_indianization_desc: "Long ago, Indian culture made its way toward South East Asia through merchants and warfare. Hinduism and Buddhism, both Indian at their heart, spread forth through the islands and tropical lands, and to go along with this, Indian culture imparted various ways of organizing royalty in society and also the writing systems of various people groups. Since the Tamils are the foremost holders of Tamil culture and other Indian cultures, we could be in a position to bring a sort of second age of Indianzation, albeit with a bit more force behind it."s well as seen to have adequate legitimacy."


 #Tamilakam Events#
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.1.a: "Vijayanagara, the City of Victory"
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.1.b: "The once illustrious city that the Vijayanagara Empire called its home is now ours. Being a haven for Hindu refugees fleeing the Delhi Sultanate in the north from centuries past, Vijayanagara has grown to be a city of great prestige and honor to many and it standing tall has made it a monument against Islam's influence southward and a bastion of Hinduism. To many Hindus in our own lands and elsewhere, the City of Victory is something that no Muslim power should ever be able to destroy.\nTamil warriors and officials have come through to the city to take what they please, but there are some who are advising caution against the looting, saying that doing as such would hamper what could possibly amount to a great center of administration for Tamilakam. Whether or not these cautious people in our ranks are right remains to be seen, but there might be value in having an administrative center further to the north. There is, however, much value to be gained in looting the city entirely and bringing its wealth and much of its populace back to our own capital further south."
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.1.c: "Set the city ablaze and loot it; adorn our capital with what its grandeur."
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.1.d: "Leave it. We have other matters to attend to."
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.1.e: "We can reap better rewards later, if we show compassion now."
 
 
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.2.a: "Bidar, the Center of the Deccan"
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.2.b: "Bidar, once the great city of the Bahmani sultans who broke off from the Delhi sultans far to the north. It has shown great potential for not only agriculture, but also for trade, development, and power as time has gone on. Tamil officials are no fools when it comes to these facts since the Bahmani sultans were in a sense a lingering presence of the wretched Delhi incursions that happened centuries ago toward our homeland; those sultans of the Turquoise Throne had to gather and cement power somewhere and this city was it.\nNow that the Tamil have control of it and now a sizable Muslim minority population within Bidar itself, what shall be done with the city? Burning and looting the city seems like a poor choice to most since it is a great center of trade, and there are many more Muslims in the city than previously anticipated. Still, we can go through with it if we really want to, but other options are certainly available to us."
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.2.c: "It can function on its own with normal care from us."
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.2.d: "Let the city become an impassable wall of stone to any invader."
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.2.e: "We can try to cultivate religious peace and innovative thinking in the city."
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.2.f: "It will be a bastion for Hindus and Jains. Expel the Muslims at once."
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.2.g: "Through Vijayanakar and Pitar, we will guide the Deccan into the future."
 
 
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.3.a: "Delhi, the Seat of Sultans"
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.3.b: "How long has it been since the once mighy sultans of Delhi reached beyond the Narmada River in the Deccan? Centuries... And so far have they fallen away from that once lofty place they were once in. The power that stemmed from Delhi when it was first taken over by Muhammad Ghori after winning the Second Battle of Tarain in 1192, it was greater than so many empires from before. The Gujara-Pratihara from Rajasthan, the Pala Empire that came from Bengal, and even the great Gupta Empire of the past could not compare to the power that the sultans of Delhi cultivated from the 1200s to the middle of the 1400s. That power has now fractured and withered away entirely, leading to our glorious march on the final heart of Muslim power in India as a whole!\nToday, Tamils march through Delhi's streets with triumphal status and great prestige as Hindus have reclaimed the great city for themselves after centuries of turmoil and defeat. The Muslims of Delhi are now fearful of what we might to do them since they are no longer in power and they may indeed be right to have fear in their hearts. Do we put the Muslims and subsequently the city to the sword and fire? Or do we show tolerance to Delhi as a whole and make it a crowning jewel to our conquests?"
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.3.c: "It is a nice city as it is."
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.3.d: "They do not deserve punishment, but rather, compassion and compromise."
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.3.e: "Mosques will be replaced by temples; Muslims will be replaced by Hindus."
 
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.4.a: "Another Tamil Sangam?"
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.4.b: "Centuries upon centuries ago, the Pandya Dynasty hosted the Tamil Sangams, assemblies of scholars and poets alike to compile and produce grand works of literature. Though the First Sangam (dated many thousands of years ago) and the Second Sangam (approximately 4400 years after the first one) are likely mythical and without much validity to them, the Third Sangam (starting some 1850 years before Christanity emerged and going until that point) certainly has validity as the mainstay of Sangam Literature dates to this exact time period. The earliest Tamil literary works date to the Third Sangam which had some 49 members and 449 poets involved and it is described to have been held on the banks of the Pond of Golden Lotuses in the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai.\nSince we have come so far in reclaiming our ancestral lands and reinvigorating Tamil culture throughout Tamilakam, it seems only right that scholars and poets from all over our land are starting to come together once more, petitioning for a new Sangam to be held. The only catch is that, as per tradition, each Sangam is to be held in a different capital location, just as was done in tradition. The First, Second, and Third Sangams were held in different capital cities, the first two being submerged eventually but the last being in what we currently know as Madurai. Do we accept this petition and willingly shift our political capital for these scholars and poets?"
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.4.c: "Patronizing Tamil literature is only right."
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.4.d: "We have different matters to attend to."
