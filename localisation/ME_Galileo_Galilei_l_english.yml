 ME_Galileo_Events.1.T: "Galileo Galilei"
 ME_Galileo_Events.1.D: "'He's an artist', 'No! I say, he must be a scientist!', 'Are we sure he isn't just a master builder? 'But he was building with cannon balls!'\nWord spread quickly of a young man called Gallileo Gallilei whose achievements prelude his inminent fame. He embodies the ideals of our time, a man of unbounded curiosity, of many skills, and even more thirst for knowledge. If he were to be a soldier, he'd became an outstanding soldier. If he were a lowly monk, we would soon see him become an archbishop, if he were an artist, why, all artists would vy to be Gallileo."
 ME_Galileo_Events.1.OPT1: "Let him decorate our court with the most beautiful frescoes."
 ME_Galileo_Events.1.OPT2: "Set this man out to make our fields so much more productive"
 ME_Galileo_Events.1.OPT3: "His thoughts alone are worth gold"

 ME_Galileo_Events.2.T: "The Leaning Tower of Pisa's experiment"
 ME_Galileo_Events.2.D: "Has he gone mad? The famous Galileo is rambling about disapproving the theory of the late Aristotle! He's set on dropping cannonballs from the roof of the tower of Pisa. For now, he calls this a thought experiment, but with each passing day, it appears he's becoming more and more determined."
 ME_Galileo_Events.2.OPT1: "Only a fool would call him a fool"
 ME_Galileo_Events.2.OPT2: "Forbid him to do such trivial things"

 ME_Galileo_Events.3.T: "An Outstanding Discovery"
 ME_Galileo_Events.3.D: "By god, what he said was true. Objects from the same material but different masses will touch the ground at the same time. This is an interesting discovery, but possibly very outrageous to religious men of science. We could keep this experiment secret, and silence the word of others, or we could challenge the very foundation which we stand in."
 ME_Galileo_Events.3.OPT1: "It was all a a thought experiment, nothing happened."
 ME_Galileo_Events.3.OPT2: "We stand corrected, so can the pope."

 ME_Galileo_Events.4.T: "Pedestrian Killed!"
 ME_Galileo_Events.4.D: "Disaster! A pedestrian was killed by a falling cannonball. We cannot hide the truth from the world, with blood in the hands of Gallileo, intentional or not. Nevertheless, what he said was true. Objects from the same material but different masses will touch the ground at the same time. This is an interesting discovery, but possibly very outrageous to religious men of science. We could keep this experiment secret, and silence the word of others, or we could challenge the very foundation which we stand in. We must act quickly, for better or worse."
 ME_Galileo_Events.4.OPT1: "Kill him, a dead man is always innocent"
 ME_Galileo_Events.4.OPT2: "We cannot have this man die, not now"
 ME_Galileo_Events.4.OPT3: "Silence this, by whatever means possible:"

 ME_Galileo_Events.5.T: "The Theory of Tides"
 ME_Galileo_Events.5.D: "My lord, Galileo has gone and done it again: he argues to know about the nature of tides. But common logic and reason are enough to poke arguments in his theory. He argues that the tides must be caused by the movement of Earth. We see no problem with this, but his ideas are actively clashing with other contemporary men like Johannes Kepler and people in power. Should we curb him while we can?"
 ME_Galileo_Events.5.OPT1: "We stand by the truth at all times"
 ME_Galileo_Events.5.OPT2: "My word is power, silence him"

 ME_Galileo_Events.6.T: "A possible tutor"
 ME_Galileo_Events.6.D: "The results of the tower experiment has made Galileo consider shying away from public life. Apart from his experiments and contributions to the court, he finds himself with much time available, and our heir has had a great deal of conversations with him. You could make him teach your heir–a man of this many talents is not found so easily."
 ME_Galileo_Events.6.OPT1: "There's no better investment than on the future"
 ME_Galileo_Events.6.OPT2: "A man of his talents should not be waste his time on a child. Open a school."
 ME_Galileo_Events.6.OPT3: "Why expect change from the future when you can seize the initiative?"

 ME_Galileo_Events.7.T: "The Assayer"
 ME_Galileo_Events.7.D: "My lord My lord! Galileo is at it again! He has just published a book about stars, which criticizes prominent Jesuit Orazio Grassi. While his arguments are questionable, namely that comets are just hot air, his methodology and dissection of the topic is most interesting—analytical, unattached, and logical. The Assayer echoes the thoughts of the Englishman Francis Bacon, and could possibly pave way to a new way of thought."
 ME_Galileo_Events.7.OPT1: "We pave way to a new era"
 ME_Galileo_Events.7.OPT2: "Dedicate this work... to his Holiness the Pope"
 ME_Galileo_Events.7.OPT3: "Galileo, we must not bite the hand that feeds us"

 ME_Galileo_Events.8.T: "The Pope likes it"
 ME_Galileo_Events.8.D: "In a true shock to our own genius, dedicating this book to the Pope has nullified any issues that could've sprung up: Grassi can't  bad mouth us to the Vatican, and any underhanded actions would be staining the name of the Pope himself. If anything, this move has bestowed upon us the favor of the Pope."
 ME_Galileo_Events.8.OPT1: "Magnifico!"

 ME_Galileo_Events.9.T: "The Pope hates it"
 ME_Galileo_Events.9.D: "In a true shock to our own genius, this move has utterly failed. The pope not only hates us, but has lashed out against our idea of dedicating a book that attacks his own brethen."
 ME_Galileo_Events.9.OPT1: "Terribile!"

 ME_Galileo_Events.10.T: "The Arcetri observatory"
 ME_Galileo_Events.10.D: "Galileo has grown increasingly focused on the stars of the night. Many a day, or to be more precise, many a night does he spends sighing at the stars, as if deciphering some unknown map. One day, he came to us with a most peculiar offer: a relatively distanced building, with little illumination and with the sole purpose to study the stars."
 ME_Galileo_Events.10.OPT1: "Per Ardua ad Astra"
 ME_Galileo_Events.10.OPT2: "Focus on what’s around you, not on what’s above"

 ME_Galileo_Events.11.T: "The debate on Heliocentrism"
 ME_Galileo_Events.11.D: "This may be the last straw: Galileo has challenged the very Earth we stand on! Does the sun circle around the earth, or are we the ones turning around? He scarcely uttered a single word on the discussion, and the entirety of Christianity is on our backs. We have little control over the matter, but there’s still a few things we can do…"
 ME_Galileo_Events.11.OPT1: "Kill him. My plans shall not be hindered now by a mortal man"
 ME_Galileo_Events.11.OPT2: "Bribe the Church officials:"
 ME_Galileo_Events.11.OPT3: "Convince Galileo to quiet down"
