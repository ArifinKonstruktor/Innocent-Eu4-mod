 ARL_Support_of_the_Qizilbash_desc: "The Qizilbashi have been founded by Grandmaster Sheikh Haydar of the Safavid Order in the 15th century. The elite units form the backbone of the Safavid forces and are identifiable by their famous crimson headwear, which indicates their adherence to the Twelve Imams. Each ruler of the Safavid Order needs to gain loyalty of these militant corps if he is to achieve greatness."

 ARL_Gilan_title: "Connections in Gilan"
 ARL_Gilan_desc: "The Safavid affiliation to the Gilani dates back many years. We must look after our relationship for generations to come, as no nation succeeds alone. There is no empire that ever rose without previously forging strategic alliances, and it would be foolish to us to ignore the knowledge history has shown us."
 ARL_Revenge_on_Shirvanshah_title: "Revenge on Shirvanshah"
 ARL_Revenge_on_Shirvanshah_desc: "The Shahs of Shirvan are the root cause of the turmoil following the death of Ismail's ancestor. The father of our Grandmaster has been murdered by the Shirvanshah himself. Such insult cannot be tolerated and it is time for the Sheikh to Avenge his father."
 ARL_Partition_Biapas_title: "Partition Biapas"
 ARL_Partition_Biapas_desc: "The Sunnite state of Biapas lies between us and our faithful allies in Gilan. With the Ardabili claims to their Astaran possessions and the recently seized territory of Fuman that they have stolen from Gilan, their offenses must be brought to the justice of Allah."

 ARL_Capture_Tabriz_desc: "Tabriz, a great city which was previously the seat of the Qara Qoyunlu who in turn were a danger to our state now lies in turmoil caused by the instability in the region. We must seize the opportunity and end the dominance of the Black Sheep."
 ARL_Into_Persia_title: "Defeat Ajam"
 ARL_Into_Persia_desc: "The Ardabili state lays a claim to the northern territories of Azerbaijan, which is currently controlled by the prince Muhammad Baysonqor of the Timurid dynasty.

 ARL_Luristan_desc: "The territory settled by the Luris lies on the western bank of the Zagros mountains and includes many significant passages that run through the great mountains.

 ARL_Iraq_title: "Subdue Mesopotamia"
 ARL_Iraq_desc: "Mesopotamia is the land which housed many prestigious states in the past and it is truly the cradle of the Muslim Golden Era. While the importance of Baghdad has largely diminished, the controllers of Baghdad are still very influential in the muslim world."
 ARL_Shahanshah_title: "The Shahanshah"
 ARL_Shahanshah_desc: "Shahanshah 'The King of Kings' is the title that each persian ruler refers himself as. As the rising power in Persia, which exerts its influence on many surrounding states already, it is the time for the Safavid Shah to crown himself as the King of Kings."
 ARL_The_Persian_Gulf_Trade_title: "Persian Gulf Trade"
 ARL_The_Persian_Gulf_Trade_desc: "The Persian Gulf Trade is essential to the economy of our state, as if the goods extracted in the ports of Mesopotamia didn't reach us, the Safavid military and economy would be crippled. We must increase our influence in the region and steer the merchants from Baghdad to Ardabil."
 ARL_Fars_title: "The Farsi Possessions"
 ARL_Fars_desc: "The Farsi state is in control of the historical origin of the ancient Persian Empires and is threatening the legitimacy of our Shah. Securing Fars, and sorrounding areas would let us legitimize our claims to the Persian Empires of the past."
 ARL_Flow_from_hormuz_title: "Control of the Strait"
 ARL_Flow_from_hormuz_desc: "While the control of the goods that are unloaded in the mouth of Euphrates is important, it will not bring us any good if all products are not going through the straits of Hormuz.

 ARL_Shia_Propaganda_title: "Shia Propaganda"
 ARL_Shia_Propaganda_desc: "With our boundaries reaching the Ottoman Empire, our relentless push west has been stopped by a Sunnite Power that is trying to prevent our recruitment of Turkic Tribes. We must establish a spy network in the Ottoman State to establish contacts with the Shia minorities and to sow discontent with their Osman overlords among them."
 ARL_Unexpected_contender_title: "Unexpected Contender"
 ARL_Unexpected_contender_desc: "With the rise of the Osman rulers it was only a matter of time until the Levant would become the battleground for the Turko-Mamluk squabbles. It's time for the unexpected third contender to enter the conflict."
 ARL_adopt_persian_administration_title: "Adopt Persian Administration"
 ARL_adopt_persian_administration_desc: "Our administration in its current state is not the most Persian one can find. With our growing influence in Persia, we must adopt a much better alternative to our currently outdated one." #This needs improvement
 ARL_the_third_force_title: "The Third Force"
 ARL_the_third_force_desc: "The Georgians are referred as the 'Third Force' with their immense influence in our state.

 ARL_Qurchi_guard_title: "The Qurchi Guard"

 ARL_Gholams_title: "Balance the Power"
 ARL_Gholams_desc: "With the concessions that have been given to the Qurchi, we are starting to witness their rise in power. If nothing is done, the Qurchi might take over our state and partition the Safavid Empire between themselves. To combat this, we must create the elite Gholams - Christian slaves that have been converted to Shia and soon will form the elite infantry of the Safavid Empire."
 ARL_Shia_state_religion_title: "Establish the State Religion"
 ARL_Shia_state_religion_desc: "As a Shia Order, it is time we establish the Twelver Shias as our state religion and start fulfilling our holy duties - spreading the word and converting heretics to the Shia ways."
 ARL_invite_shia_scholars_title: "Invite Shia Scholars"
 ARL_invite_shia_scholars_desc: "To aid the conversion of the state, we need a skilled priesthood that will help fill the lack of clergy in the mosques.

 ARL_conversion_of_mosques_title: "Conversion of Mosques"
 ARL_conversion_of_mosques_desc: "If we are to convert Persia to Shia, we need to halt the sunni prayers and shatter their unity that they possess in their mosques. The fate of Sunni mosques is clear - they will either be converted to Shia or be destroyed."

 ME_Ardabil_Events.1.d: "The Safavids have had a long-standing grudge with the monarchs of Shirvan for decades ever since the Safaviyya Order have made contacts with the Shirvanshah. The product of this conflict is the death of [Root.Monarch.GetName], our beloved Sheikh who left the world as a result of a battle against the Shirvanshah. We do not have to worry, as there is a skilled, albeit young successor to take his place."
 ME_Ardabil_Events.1.a: "The Succession is Safe."
 
 ME_Ardabil_Events.2.t: "Tabriz Captured"
 ME_Ardabil_Events.2.d: "On this blessed day we have taken over the capital city of our former enemies and its surroundings. The Qara Qoyunlu have been a threat to us for far too long but with the recent victory of ours we have become the new hegemon of the area. Now, with the formal acquisition of the great city of Tabriz, it is time for the Sheikh [Root.Monarch.GetName] to crown himself as the rightful Shah in Tabriz."
 ME_Ardabil_Events.2.a: "Wonderful News!"
 
 ME_Ardabil_Events.3.t: "To Please the Qizilbashi"
 ME_Ardabil_Events.3.d: "The Qizilbashi are truly the backbone of our army and without their loyalty, we will not be able to wage war on a large scale. If we are to conquer Persia, there is only one choice: To cede the Tabriz countryside to the Qizilbashi."
 ME_Ardabil_Events.3.a: "A Novel Idea!"
 ME_Ardabil_Events.3.b: "We can't afford to rely on them."
 
 ME_Ardabil_Events.4.t: "Our Allies in Gilan"
 ME_Ardabil_Events.4.d: "We have been in a alliance with the rulers of Gilan for a decades and our states are in a long-lasting friendship. Before the ascension of Ismail to the Safavid Throne he took refuge in Gilan and was raised there. The lasting alliance ought not to be broken, yet it must evolve. It is the time for the Shah of Gilan to become an Ardabili vassal."
 ME_Ardabil_Events.4.a: "Sure, the relationship should evolve."
 ME_Ardabil_Events.4.b: "Keep it the way it is."
 
 ME_Ardabil_Events.5.t: "The Rising Safavid Order"
 ME_Ardabil_Events.5.d: "We have cradled the Safavid ruler before he created his mighty state and now he has the gall to request our vassalage. If we are to deny his request, the alliance will be formally kept but time will tell if the Safavid successors will see us as a worthy ally or not."
 ME_Ardabil_Events.5.a: "Sure, the relationship should evolve."
 ME_Ardabil_Events.5.b: "Keep it the way it is."
 
 ME_Ardabil_Events.6.t: "The Third Estate"
 ME_Ardabil_Events.6.d: "The Georgian People inside our country have been very influential since the humble origins of our state. Now, with Georgia conquered, we are in control of their homeland and we can please the Georgian estate by giving special autonomy and protection to the Georgian Lands."
 ME_Ardabil_Events.6.a: "Georgians should have high autonomy!"
 ME_Ardabil_Events.6.b: "All this land is mine and that triagonal sign! ! They're mine, mine, mine, mine, mine!
 
 ME_Ardabil_Events.7.t: "Sunni Sites in Baghdad"
 ME_Ardabil_Events.7.d: "Baghdad is the home to several holy Sunni sites such as the tombs of Abu Hanifa, grave of Abdul-Qadir Gilani and many other Sunni Saints. Our soldiers upon entering the city started desecrating such sites but were stopped by one of the lesser commanders of our army. Destroying the holy sites of Sunni will show the Muslim world the power of our shia state and cripple the faith of the Sunnis. While the destruction of the sites would bring us many benefits, it might be better to keep them intact to quell the Sunni unrest."
 ME_Ardabil_Events.7.a: "Desecrate them!"
 ME_Ardabil_Events.7.b: "We should not go too far."
