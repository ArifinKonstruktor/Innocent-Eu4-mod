 gol_horde_title: "Call Up The Horde"
 gol_horde_desc: "How can we call ourselves a true horde, If we have no riders. If the hoof beat of our march doesn't shake the very earth itself."
 gol_crim_title: "Graze On New Pastures"
 gol_crim_desc: "Our new horde has many horses to feed and little land to graze them on. Just nearby is much fetile land, supposedly claimed by our weak neighbours. But we need it more than them, and that is reason enough to take it for our own."
 gol_nogai_title: "Blood To Be Shed"
 gol_nogai_desc: "We have reached the very edge of the great steppes to our west. The only solution to this must be to turn eastwards. Our most vulnerable neighbour sits weak and and docile in their lands, begging to be taken."
 gol_uzbek_title: "Kazakhs and Uzbeks"
 gol_uzbek_desc: "Is there really any need for petty reasons at this point? We are a Horde. Slaughter is our business, Murder our currency and Pillaging our entertainment. And it is time to go to work."
 gol_kazan_title: "Fools To Our North"
 gol_kazan_desc: "It has been some time since the Golden Horde dissolved into our many warring tribes. Of all the successors, the most pathetic without a doubt is the Kazani Horde to our north. Bring them to heel. Perhaps that way they shall have a worth beyond watering the steppes."
 gol_sib_title: "Siberian Front"
 gol_sib_desc: "While our horses are perfect for the wide and open steppes. The cold of the north are no fit place for our horses. We must secure land in this inhospitable place, and therefore will require horses that can survive it. We could breed these horses. Or we could take them from our lessers. After all, what right do they have to refuse the Great Horde?"
 gol_khan_title: "Khan Of The Steppes"
 gol_khan_desc: "Westerners occasionally dare to tread the steppe, bringing with them wonderous technology, strange knowledge and weird ways of thinking. Every time, they ask to meet with the leader of the steppe peoples, and yet there is no true leader. If they mistake us for such a powerful ruler, who are we to correct them?"
 gol_westerners_title: "Western Traders"
 gol_westerners_desc: "Little trade flows across the steppe, but all that does, goes to one of two destinations. To the North West, to the remnants of the Rus, long cast down into the dirt. Or to the banks of the Black Sea, where ships transport goods out into the Mediteranian and beyond. As of now, westerner colonies dominate this coastline, and therefore are the primary benefactors for all trade through it. It is time we turned these settlements to our purposes."
 gol_ryazan_title: "Rape And Pillage"
 gol_ryazan_desc: "Sheep Herders dare to try to exist on the steppe, in obvious defiance of our rule. Teach them the error of their ways."
 gol_weaklings_title: "Weaklings And Vermin"
 gol_weaklings_desc: "The Caucasus to our south forms a natural barrier between our glorious domain, and the worthless lands beyond the mountains. But slowly, refugees fleeing Tamurlane and other great conqerors have scared them north of the border. That shall now end."
 gol_debt_title: "Repay The Debt"
 gol_debt_desc: "Despite their claims of independance, the Muscovites still owe tribute to the Golden Horde, and as the true successors, that tribute rightfully belongs to us. And yet it doesn't come. I suppose that means we must go and collect it ourselves. And show the Muscovites our displeasure at the same time."
