 #Central Indian & Nagpur Missions#
 cen_ind_unity_and_foundation_title: "Planting of Roots"
 cen_ind_unity_and_foundation_desc: "The politics of Central India are constantly in flux as of now. Chiefs and Rajas are making claims and fighting over various pieces of land that are hard to maintain, but who is to say this volatile region can't become prosperous and stable? That is what we must ultimately strive for as of now. It will be a struggle against those of equal size to us, but great states are not born out of mere thin air."
 cen_ind_infrastructure_and_money_title: "Burgeoning State"
 cen_ind_infrastructure_and_money_desc: "The internal foundation of our state is fairly rural and underdeveloped with only the capital seeing widespread urban growth. Still, even with this, our control remains tenuous in certain areas what with locals still seeing themselves as partially independent or autonomous. By securing a more stable political environment and actively promoting building projects to not only boost our wealth and prestige but also to help grow some of the smaller cities we control, we will garner more trust with our own people."
 cen_ind_hindu_scholars_title: "Forward Thinking"
 cen_ind_hindu_scholars_desc: "Tied down before by tribal politics and feuding clans, we have found our way past those times and toward an active and somewhat centralized administration. Now is the time to begin looking toward those who can benefit the central court most, whether they be interested in the natural sciences or in the art of military strategies."
 cen_ind_summon_chief_troops_title: "Chiefs and Officers"
 cen_ind_summon_chief_troops_desc: "Scattered are many military-oriented people in our land. Chiefs and officers alike are seemingly more bound to their villages and communities than to us of the administration, but we must work to change this and slowly but surely move to a more centralized and loyal military system that transcends tribal and clan loyalties."
 cen_ind_first_conquests_title: "Draw First Blood"
 cen_ind_first_conquests_desc: "The jungles and forests do not settle down just because political shifts in cities occur, no, they rumble loudly with the might elephants and people alike! Like our ancestors before us have tried to, let us do the same and wage war on our neighbors so that we may finally strive to unite the Gondi, Garjati, the Jharkhandi!"
 cen_ind_refined_fighting_title: "Refined Fighting"
 cen_ind_refined_fighting_desc: "The Gondi, Garjati, and Jharkhandi are seen as primitive to the other states in the north, south, and west. They see us as tribal and unable to adapt to changing times, but we are proving them wrong as each day, week, and month goes by. The surest sign of this is our use of and slow integration of firearms into the ranks of our soldiers; with them, the battles fought by our people will no longer be so one-sided."
 cen_ind_legit_administration_title: "Rule with Authority"
 cen_ind_legit_administration_desc: "Our administration has often struggled to maintain internal unity and peace as several communities are influenced by tribal politics and clan events whilst paying little attention or service to the central authority. In order to being changing this, we need to make sure we are a stable and authoritative state, and also one that can put down insurgencies before they get a chance to make progress. Once this is done, we can begin the slow process of centralization."
 cen_ind_basic_loyalties_title: "Basic Loyalty"
 cen_ind_basic_loyalties_desc: "The administration is not just an isolated body that dictates people from afar, not in the slightest. There are several parts of our administration that are integrated within the lower castes of society and we need each and every single part of the administration to work together so that we do not fall prey to stagnation and decadence."
 cen_ind_landed_elites_title: "Landed Elites"
 cen_ind_landed_elites_desc: "The most power-hungry of the administration's sectors are the Brahmins and the Rajputs and this is well known by many. Respected as they are in our state, they are also attempting to increase their power and influence throughout the land at the expense of others. This, of course, clashes with other parts of the administration at times but we try to keep this all in check through effective and coherent land distribution to various families and dynasties. We must make sure that the Brahmins and Rajputs stay loyal through this land distrbution, lest we want them to actively hinder our efforts elsewhere."
 cen_ind_southern_area_title: "Contest for Garjat"
 cen_ind_southern_area_desc: "The area of Garjat has been home to several tribes for a long time but it was once the crossroads of several ancient, classical, and medieval Indian kingdoms and empires. Historically and culturally significant but still being very hard to tame, we must do what few have ever done and take over Garjat as a whole and lock it down."
 cen_ind_central_area_title: "Seize Upper Manhandi"
 cen_ind_central_area_desc: "The heart of where most people consider tribal in India, the Upper Mahandi area has been a tough place to invade by several powers from the past including the Delhi Sultanate. True unity can only come from within the region as a whole and we must be the one to do so before another foreign power attempts to exert power over the area."
 cen_ind_northern_area_title: "Fight for Jharkhand"
 cen_ind_northern_area_desc: "On the border with the Oriya, Bengali, and Bihari people, Jharkhand is very much a lucrative yet dangerous area. The ferocity of the northern Islamic powers is well known and their line-of-sight often has parts of Jharkhand within it, but the Jharkhandi are resilient people who have put a fight every single time the Muslims striked at them. Let us bring these fighters and traders into our fold before they are ultimately overwhelmed by others."
 cen_ind_final_places_title: "The Final Steps"
 cen_ind_final_places_desc: "The coming power of the Gondi, Garjati, and Jharkhandi people is without end as our neighbors know that we are a true power in Indian politics. We must not stop here, however; we must strive to unite all of our kin under one flag rather than being split up between various foreign powers. Once we have enough power beneath us, we will find ourselves ready to become a truly unified state that started from the ground up with a burgeoning capital to go along with it."
 nagpur_develop_the_capital_title: "Developments in Nagpur"
 nagpur_develop_the_capital_desc: "Nagpur itself is still a young city with many families moving in and construction projects actively working to make the city beautiful and functional. Focusing our efforts on it so that it can become an administrative, cultural, and military center will bolster our progress toward making an imperial capital in Central India, and what good is an imperial capital without a proper fortress anyways?"
 nagpur_culture_and_religion_title: "Social Cohesiveness"
 nagpur_culture_and_religion_desc: "Despite our progress as a unified state, the Gondi, Garjati, and Jharkhandi still get into disputes and feuds regarding religion and tradition. Our officials can try to keep order on a local level, but continuing feuds have spiraled into riots and revolts the likes of which are very destructive to several communities. We must take action and we must impose order as much as we can by cooperating with some groups and exiling others, but we must never turn away those who are our true kin."
 nagpur_take_andhra_title: "Strike at Andhra"
 nagpur_take_andhra_desc: "To the south along the coast are the Telugu people. They are a distinct and tough group of people and have carved out their own nations in the past, but their power wanes now as their dynastic lines wither and their military power dwindles. Let us strike at one of the last independent bastions of Telugu resistance, Andhra, and seize the land for ourselves."
 nagpur_the_bengal_delta_title: "Bengal's Last Stand"
 nagpur_the_bengal_delta_desc: "The Bengali Sultanate and those other smaller states of Bengali culture have sought to exert control over the coasts and inland, but have struggled to do so in the past. Now that that Nagpur is surging with power and might, the Bengalis suddenly find themselves on a much more equal play field against us. Let us deliver unto them their final blow and win this centuries-long conflict."
 nagpur_assam_and_koch_title: "Venturing North"
 nagpur_assam_and_koch_desc: "What the Bengali Sultanate sought to control in the north were the states at the seat of the great mountains in the north and the states that lie in the jungles to the northeast. Nagpur officials do see these states as viable threats to our new borders in the north and if they are successful at raiding our land, we could see ourselves lose control over the Bengal Region itself. Thus, we are tasked with asserting dominance over the northern states and integrating the Bengal Delta region into Nagpur more so that our power is secured."
 nagpur_harsh_land_cultivation_title: "Harsh Land Cultivation"
 nagpur_harsh_land_cultivation_desc: "The forests and jungles of our heartland are not easy to make useful since they require great amounts of effort and manpower to work. Draining areas of water, chopping down groves of trees, and levelling out land for further usage are all required for us to make once untamed land into something useful and in the end, it will be worth the effort."
 nagpur_three_part_military_title: "Three-Part Military"
 nagpur_three_part_military_desc: "In Nagpur, there is a sense of unity that goes beyond just mere communities and local administrations. We see this unity display itself on several levels throughout Nagpur but we have yet to see it displayed in the military. Our three principle groups of people, the Gondi, Garjati, and Jharkhandi, still vie for ultimate power in the military which leads to mishaps and disputes that are often hard to deal with. We must put in the effort to stop this and promote unity here as well; formulating a solid plan of a triple-sectioned military that comprises of all three people groups should help lay the foundation for us."
 nagpur_telugu_takeover_title: "Telugu Takeover"
 nagpur_telugu_takeover_desc: "The Telugu people are no longer able to maintain themselves like before, what with the fall of Andhra and the coast being seized already. We must finish the job and take over the entirety of Telugu-held land so that Nagpur may have an open corridor of expansion into other places."
 nagpur_become_overlords_title: "Turn the Tide"
 nagpur_become_overlords_desc: "No longer are the three oppressed people of the subcontinent subjects of foreign powers! They are united and stronger than ever before, but that does not mean the unified state of Nagpur needs no allies nor subjects. To exert outward influence and to ensure our safety, we should be looking to have subject states beneath us and strong allies abroad who can can come to the aid of Nagpur should times call for it."
 nagpur_economic_overhaul_title: "Economic Overhaul"
 nagpur_economic_overhaul_desc: "With our economy seeing a steady rise in production and the Vaishya Caste steadily becoming more fruitful in their contribution to the overall prosperity of Nagpur, we are ready to shift things even more and begin the process of overhauling traditional methods of production. Doing so will require great amounts of money and the trust of a great many people, but in time this effort will come back to repay us in the form of a stronger and more robust economy."
 nagpur_dominate_bengali_trade_title: "Stabilize Bengali Trade"
 nagpur_dominate_bengali_trade_desc: "The destruction of the Bengali Sultanate has come at a slight cost to Nagpur in terms of manpower and resources, but the profits are going to far outweigh what we once paid. The trade routes into and out of the region are like no other and once granted the sultans enormous amounts of wealth and power, but they squandered it all during their time in power. Nagpur will do better with such trade revenue, but first we needs to ensure that the trade actually flows in ways that are beneficial for Nagpur as a whole."
 nagpur_trunk_road_entrance_title: "Northern Tensions"
 nagpur_trunk_road_entrance_desc: "To our north are the domains of Jaunpur and those similar to it. They have not tried to make incusions against us yet, but we should not wait for them to do so. We must take action before they can make any move against us and secure a firm hold on the Grand Trunk Road."
 nagpur_toward_delhi_title: "To Take Delhi"
 nagpur_toward_delhi_desc: "Following the path northward, we see that there is a lot of potential for future conquests, but these cities are valuable in more ways than one and must be preserved as much as possible when we invade for them. Places like Kannauj and Delhi may be sources of power against Nagpur, but they are not strong enough to defy us for long. The battle for Northern India must and will be won by Nagpur."
 nagpur_fleet_ambitions_title: "Nagpuri Ships"
 nagpur_fleet_ambitions_desc: "With the legacy of a strong navy still present in Bengali administrators and locals, Nagpuri officials are beginning to see things from their perspective. Sure, our dominance of trade routes in and around the Bengal Delta is good, but we must ensure that it is always protected as well! What good is ocean trade if part or all of it gets plundered by privateers or destroyed by enemy fleets?"
 nagpur_seize_punjab_title: "Close off the Khyber"
 nagpur_seize_punjab_desc: "With much of the heart of Northern India under our control, many Nagpuri officials are pointing out that we must obtain some of the final pieces of the north in order to secure India's entrance: the Khyber Pass. Once we take over the pass itself and also the places it leads directly into, we can proclaim ourselves as the true unifiers of Northern India."
 nagpur_arakan_ports_title: "Succeed where they Failed"
 nagpur_arakan_ports_desc: "For a very long time, Arakan and and its neighbors down south have been hubs of piracy that drain away Bengali trade power. The Sultanate attempted to deal with these threats, but only managed curtail them for a short time before they were actively pursuing their own interests again. It is time that Nagpur did what the sultans could not do and officially end the pirate ports in the east."
 nagpur_vijayanagar_invasion_title: "Overthrow the Sangamas!"
 nagpur_vijayanagar_invasion_desc: "Southern India has not known true peace in ages; some say that it will never know peace at all, but we can change that. The Sangama Dynasty of the Vijayanagara Empire (founded by the brothers Harihara I and Bukka Raya I in 1336) has held power for a long time after the fall of the Hoysala Empire in about 1343, but their control is not universal, not yet at least. We need to strike a fatal blow at the heart of this empire before it can grow further and rival us even more."
 nagpur_bahmanid_invasion_title: "Destroy the Bahmanids!"
 nagpur_bahmanid_invasion_desc: "The revolt of former Delhi general Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah in 1347 proved successful and the Bahamani Sultanate was established in the heart of the Deccan Plateau. This Shiite Sultanate is what we currently must contend with in our current situation and though they are powerful, they are not invincible. Since its inception, the Bahmanids have fought against the Sangamas for control over the Southern Deccan meaning that we can use this consistent conflict as a way for Nagpur to invade and seize the capital of Bidar and more."
 nagpur_malvi_invasion_title: "Strike down the Khalji!"
 nagpur_malvi_invasion_desc: "When the Delhi Sultanate was in a steep decline, several governors and military officers broke off and formed their own states, one of them being the Malwa Sultanate founded by Dilawar Khan Ghuri. After being overthrown by Mahmud Khalji in May of 1436 and establishing the Khalji Dynasty, it became a serious power in the region and now it remains a threat to Nagpur to this day. Seizing Mandu and destroying the Malwa Sultanate once and for all is the only way we can resolve this matter."
 nagpur_the_marathas_title: "Control over Maharashtra"
 nagpur_the_marathas_desc: "The question the Marathas pose to us of Nagpur is a large one as they make up a decent portion of the population on the western cost just south of Gujarati lands and north of Tamil lands. They are fearless and resourceful people who will fight for their independence at every turn if they are mistreated, but we of Nagpur will ensure that this sentiment is curtailed in a myriad of ways. The Marathi people will be integral to the rise of Nagpur!"
 OWNS_ALL_MARATHI_PROVINCES_IN_ASIA: "§O[This.GetName] must own all provinces in India of Marathi culture.§!"
 nagpur_tamil_invasion_title: "Into the Jungles"
 nagpur_tamil_invasion_desc: "The lands of Southern India are very hard to maintain control over as the Sangamas saw firsthand. Tamil and Malayalam alike find it easy to maintain autonomy in South India because of the natural terrain and environment, but the crucial ports they hold mean that this autonomy must be taken away."
 nagpur_konkan_ports_title: "A Sword to the West"
 nagpur_konkan_ports_desc: "With Bahmanis put to our sword and dealt with, we must look toward the western ports on the Konkan coast. This was the site of great tension between the Hindus of Vijayanagar and the Muslims of Bahmanis, but now that power in the Deccan is in the capable hands of Nagpur, we can end this tension once and for all and secure the ports for ourselves. The hand of Vijayanagar may want it, but our sword will slice at them without mercy!"
 nagpur_coastal_gujarat_title: "Of Gujarat and Saurashtra"
 nagpur_coastal_gujarat_desc:  "The region of Gujarat and its neighboring area of Saurashtra are contentious but also prosperous in the amount of trade revenue they bring in. In times past, the region has given rise to powerful states that claimed hegemony in Western India, battling the rajputs in the north for dominance in the region but this time must come to an end. With our ports on the Konkan coast and our armies at the ready, we must seize the coast of the region and push north toward the Indus River Delta, securing all of Western Indian trade for ourselves."
 nagpur_rajput_lands_title: "The Question of Rajputana"
 nagpur_rajput_lands_desc: "Rajput land is not as valuable in terms of trade or production of materials, they are valuable for another reason entirely: the martial prowess of the people themselves. Previous iterations of Western India saw powerful rajput kingoms rise up and fight for dominance in the region, but internal strife and division has proven to be the downfall of the rajput people. Nagpur must and will take advantage of this and subdue the rajput people for their martial skill is just what the Nagpuri military needs."
 nagpur_last_bastions_title: "Last Bastions of Resistance"
 nagpur_last_bastions_desc: "The lands across the water in Lanka are dense in vegetation like Southern India as a whole, but for a very long time it has been a haven not for Hinduism but for Theravada Buddhism instead. The states of Kotte and Kandy sought complete control over the island and its rich amount of spices, but the power they wield is very fragile. By taking control of the island once and for all and eliminating any sort of independent presence there, Nagpur will succeed where so many other states in Southern India have failed: uniting the entirety under one flag."
 nagpur_sapta_puri_title: "Sapta Puri & Bharat"
 nagpur_sapta_puri_desc: "Ever since the rise of Islam in the Arabian Peninsula and the fall of the Sassanid Empire, Islamic incursions into the subcontinent have never ceased. From the Caliphates to the Ghurids to the Ghaznavids to the Delhi Sultanate, we have seen the likes of our beautiful subcontinent ravaged by followers of this foreign faith, but this is finally at an end. With the taking and holding down of the Sapta Puri, the seven holy pilgramage sites, in India, we may proclaim ourselves the keepers and protectors of the entirety of the subcontinent."
 
 
 

 #South Indian & Tamilakam Missions#
 south_ind_malabar_area_title: "Unite the Cheras!"
 south_ind_malabar_area_desc: "The coastal cities in Kerala were once home to the Chera Dynasty from long ago. They held some sway inland in the Kongu area, but they were mostly known for their lucrative trade along the coasts of Kerala and for being intermittent subjects of the Pandya Dynasty and the Chola Dynasty. Being of Tamilakam ourselves, we will need these coastal cities to gain legitimacy in the eyes of the people of the region."
 south_ind_jungle_development_title: "Jungle Developments"
 south_ind_jungle_development_desc: "It is not easy to cut through dense jungle that is home to a variety of wild animals and plants along. To go along with this, harsh terrain makes the job even harder and has historically made only the coasts habitable; inland settlements are rare and smaller in comparison. If we concentrate some effort on working the land, however, we can begin to make some progress toward expanding inward from the coast and toward those scattered settlements of villages. Trade, taxation, and military affairs will also benefit from the increased flexibility in travel areas."
 south_ind_madura_area_title: "Unite the Pandyas!"
 south_ind_madura_area_desc: "Madurai has been the heart of the Pandya Dynasty back when it was a grand power in the 600s to 800s and again in the 1100s to 1300s. Ever since the Muslims from the far north raided the Pandya Dynasty during a time of political crisis in the mid-1300s, their power has withered away into near nothingness. There must be a worthy state that can hold Madurai firmly against future incursions and whether or not it be a branch of the Pandya Dynasty that does this, it will return to its former glory in time."
 south_ind_build_temples_title: "Offerings to the Gods"
 south_ind_build_temples_desc: "There are many great temples in the lands of Southern India, but how do they become as great and beautiful as they are? It is through royal patronage that they become like this and we should strive to continue this legacy. The many temples and their religious followers will help garner taxes and internal unity within our state if we are able to help keep them afloat financially."
 south_ind_tanjore_area_title: "Unite the Cholas!"
 south_ind_tanjore_area_desc: "The great Chola Dynasty of the past came from the likes of the Tanjore area. They were the ones who made the world tremble at the sight of their boats and soldiers! They carved out a mighty empire the likes of which few in Southern India could ever dream of from the mid-800s to the late 1200s, ultimately being defeated by the rising power of the Pandya Dynasty and the Hoysala Empire. Taking Tanjore into our fold will help bring the whole of Tamilakam under our grasp and ensure that we have a viable area to launch naval invasions from, just as the Chola Dynasty did in ages past."
 south_ind_stable_tanjore_title: "Stability in Tanjore"
 south_ind_stable_tanjore_desc: "The Tanjore area is ripe for opportunity and development as the Chola Dynasty found out long ago. Such memories of potential in the land and the people is not lost on us, but we must start from somewhere in order to gain any sort of profit or foundation out of the area itself. Where then do we start at? It is in the form of increasing our hold over the communities so that they obey our administration."
 south_ind_stable_madura_title: "Prosperity of Madura"
 south_ind_stable_madura_desc: "Madura and its heart of Madurai is tough to rein in, but it is not impossible to do so. Garnering the good favor of local communities and integrating the people into our state over time will help stabilize the area and bring not only increased revenue to us, but also increased legitimacy."
 south_ind_stable_malabar_title: "Splendor of Kerala"
 south_ind_stable_malabar_desc: "Kerala may be lucrative but we must remember how tough the natural landscape is. Reaching out to the prosperous coastal communities and having them work in our favor instead of their own favor will help unite the entirety of the region and streamline revenue from the valuable trade cities that the Chera Dynasty once held as their own."
 south_ind_kongu_area_title: "Paths into Kongu"
 south_ind_kongu_area_desc: "The Kongu area is vital to us for a number of reasons. Those that live there are largely our Tamil brothers and sisters, but even without this cultural tie, the Kongu area is the overland entrance into the southern reaches of the Deccan. If we can secure this small but important area and lock it down firmly, our plans to the north will become all the more clear."
 south_ind_south_carnatic_area_title: "Carnatic Ambitions"
 south_ind_south_carnatic_area_desc: "The fertile flat lands along the coast just north of the Tanjore area are valued by a great many people for good reason. Trade occurs in plentiful amounts at the ports of Tondainadu and Cuddalore and along with this, fertile farmlands are available for a growing population. Thus, it is vital that we secure these two ports and the surrounding land before we get ahead of ourselves."
 south_ind_tamilakam_incarnate_title: "Homeland of the Tamils"
 south_ind_tamilakam_incarnate_desc: "Centuries upon centuries have gone by and we faced nothing but divisions and hardship. There were a few times of unification for our homeland, islands of safety and prosperity in our history that pulled away from the factionalism and petty conflicts that are recorded in our hearts and minds. Perhaps we can finally put a stop to this endless cycle of infighting and internal strife. We can learn from the Cheras, the Pandyas, and the Cholas of the past and cultivate something not seen since the Chola Empire of centuries before: a prosperous and stable Tamil empire."
 south_ind_fortify_the_frontier_title: "Garrisons and Walls"
 south_ind_fortify_the_frontier_desc: "The land of Tamilakam is quite defendable if one takes the time to build fortifications that mesh well with the harsh terrain. If we can muster the funds and materials to build fortifications that actually defend our land, the militaristic ones in our ranks will surely be pleased with us. On top of this, seeing mighty fortifications built by ones of brothers and sisters in culture will help draw people to military ranks in general, so there is little reason for us not to invest in this matter."
 south_ind_tamil_shipyards_title: "Markets and Ships"
 south_ind_tamil_shipyards_desc: "Attracting people versed in naval matters is something that we will need if ever hope to as successful on the water as our ancestors were. Sailors, admirals, and merchants that come to our vast markets will do us well when we begin to invest heavily in our navy since they can advise us on which ships to build, as well as help protect the most lucrative trade routes on the water that we use."
 
 tamil_the_maldives_title: "Tamil Islands"
 tamil_the_maldives_desc: "The islands to our south, the Maldives, are inhabited by relatives of ours, the Malayalam, but they are much more distant compared to those of Kerala. They have begun to develop separate customs entirely devoid of Tamil or traditional Malayalam influence and Muslims are the dominant class there. In order to further our own interests and to rein in our increasingly distant brothers and sisters, we must take the Maldives for ourselves. From there, we can look outward to new horizons and also begin investing in staunchly Tamil and Malayalm Hindu guilds and merchants."
 tamil_mysore_to_kanara_title: "The Southern Deccan"
 tamil_mysore_to_kanara_desc: "Our entrance into the Deccan will be rough and hostile, that is a truth we will have to live with. But with the fire of war tempering our resolve and hardening us to the likes of gunpowder warfare and tactics of the current age, we will be able to adapt and overcome what opposition is laid out before us. Mysore and the coasts of Kanara are viable places of expansion for the Tamil people, but the dynastic powers currently present may very well push us to our limit. Be careful out there."
 tamil_kin_in_ceylon_title: "Our Kin in Lanka"
 tamil_kin_in_ceylon_desc: "The Kingdom of Jaffna, the righteous Tamil kingdom with a cruel foundational ruler, is our the only Tamil remnant left on the island of Lanka that is not subject to Sinhalese authority. Whilst the Sinhalese are alright trading partners, the island of Lanka has always been rightfully Tamil and should have been taken by our ancestors long ago. We will finish what they started and destroy Sinhalese power in order to establish the island as a haven and hub for Tamil people exclusively."
 tamil_the_heart_of_vijaya_title: "The Heart of Victory"
 tamil_the_heart_of_vijaya_desc: "The great successor to the Hoysala Empire, the Vijayanagar Empire, has towered over us for many decades. Their power was once thought to be unbreakable and untouchable, but they have shown great weakness as of late. That golden luster that shined from their City of Victory is now becoming dull, fading from its peak in the previous years and becoming ripe for conquest. That crowning achievement of seizing the City of Victory should belong to the Tamils, not the Muslims of the north, and after we take it, we can decide the fate of the once great city."
 tamil_north_carnatic_seizure_title: "The Carnatic Region"
 tamil_north_carnatic_seizure_desc: "The southeast coast of India has been the homeland of the Tamils since ages ago and many people know this, from the Oriya in the north and the Marathi to the west, but still the Carnatic region, integral to our homeland, lies in pieces. Dynasties and kingdoms think that the region can be divided up as they please, thinking the Tamil people don't care what they do it, but they are sorely mistaken. Now that the Tamils are united and together once again, we will see to it that the Carnatic region is whole once more." 
 tamil_south_indian_trade_title: "Tamil Investiture"
 tamil_south_indian_trade_desc: "Tamil trade guilds are some of the more lucrative and profitable guilds in all of India! Few if any can compare to the investments and profit they earn over time what with business coming from both east and west at consistent yearly rates. If we can protect their trade routes on the open water and give them certain land rights that they were not allowed before under different dynasties, then we can ensure the loyalty, respect, and even some income from the trade guilds."
 tamil_build_up_kanara_title: "Wealth in the West"
 tamil_build_up_kanara_desc: "Just north of the Kerala area are the coastal cities of Kanara. Lying in the southern end of the Deccan though not completely in tropical jungle, these coastal cities are some of the finest in Southern India and would do well as trade centers for us. Building them up with proper infrastructure and ensuring Tamilakam administrators are watching over the cities of Kanara will bolster not only the potential of the cities in Kanara, but it will also attract new scholars and high-minded individuals from western lands."
 tamil_beginning_tamil_industry_title: "Textiles of the Tamils"
 tamil_beginning_tamil_industry_desc: "Though we are still very much agrarian and mercantile in terms of what our population does for a living, textiles and the refinement of cloth and silk into finer designs is becoming an ever more lucrative industry for us. People from far off lands and also within our own diplomatic neighborhood are becoming more and more attracted to beautifully colored garments produced by various weavers in our lands, so why should we not provide for them? Getting a firm start on textile production now can only serve to cement a prosperous future for us."
 UNLOCK_OPTION_AT_BIDAR: "§GUnlocks a beneficial option upon the capture of the Bidar.§"
 tamil_march_on_bidar_title: "Center of the Deccan"
 tamil_march_on_bidar_desc: "The powerful remnant of the Delhi Sultanate in the Deccan is the Bahmani Sultanate. Though times are changing, the presence of an independent Muslim state in the Deccan is a threat to Tamilakam as a whole. We need to seek out the end of Muslim domination in the Deccan one way or another and taking the prized city of Bidar is one way in which we can start down this path."
 tamil_toward_arabia_title: "Settle Trade Disputes"
 tamil_toward_arabia_desc: "Arabia, long has it been a willing trade partner to the coastal people of our subcontinent as it provided horses, incense, and other resources in exchange for spices, gems, and other goods from our homeland. This trade has ensured good profit for Tamilakam, but it just is not enough, especially after Arabian merchants have been scorning our seizing of the Maldives. The path for us is simple now: we will take control of the trade routes from Arabia for ourselves by force."
 tamil_horn_landing_title: "Not Good Enough"
 tamil_horn_landing_desc: "Long have Somali merchants been some of the greatest sailors and greatest merchants of the vast ocean that surrounds our subcontinent. They come to our land, do good business, and then go home during the seasonal monsoons that blow through the vast open expanses of water. This trade is rather lucrative, is it not? Tamilakam makes decent profits from Somali merchants, but we are seeing more and more flaws in the trade practices of the Somalis that can be mended if they simply were under our instruction and guidance. Perhaps it is time we make our presence truly known in their homeland."
 tamil_western_deccan_title: "Strike at the Marathi"
 tamil_western_deccan_desc: "The Marathi in the western part of the Deccan are fierce and influential in many courts. Though the Tamil people have had little contact with them previously due to the Kannada people coming between us, but now that we are on the path to greatness, the Marathi are only a piece in our grand plan. Let us ride forth and smite down any semblance of power they might have!"
 tamil_telugu_taming_title: "The Telugu Wars"
 tamil_telugu_taming_desc: "North of the homeland of the Tamils is the homeland of the Telugus. Like us, the Telugu people have their own history they look up upon with pride, especially their last great dynasty that was destroyed by the Delhi Sultanate, that which was the Kakatiya Dynasty. The Telugu people are in disarray still but they pose an active threat to our ambitions should they ever become united. We must move quickly and put an end to these skirmishes and conflicts before things spiral out of our control."
 tamil_chola_military_part_one_title: "The Chola Template"
 tamil_chola_military_part_one_desc: "When it was at its height, the Chola military was well organized and administratered. Though gunpowder was not around for them, they had a Chariot Corps, Elephant Corps, Cavalry Corps, Infanty Corps, Medical Corps, and an Auxiliary Corps. This organization on the surface along with regularly paid kaikolars (a caste in Tamil society) and other aspects of the Chola military allowed it to become a truly grand force for the subcontinent. Perhaps we can use this model of military that the Cholas had to our advantage? Modernize it to our own standards with gunpowder weapons?"
 tamil_chola_military_part_two_title: "All Under the Maharaja"
 tamil_chola_military_part_two_desc: "The organization and administration of the Chola military focused on the ancient tradition of Chaturangabala for the former, and Sadangabala for the latter. The regiments of the Chola military were somewhat autonomous and they were free to endow their own selves with small temples (and the income they provided), but their organization was still controlled by the king and the administration in the form of multiple Senais (what can be described as regiments within a single army); it was from here a Senai was divided into various Corps. We have much to learn from this time period and there is room to refine the system to a modern form. Tamilakam will need a refined and formal military like the Cholas had in order to properly defend itself."
 tamil_chola_navy_part_one_title: "Rajaraja I's Legacy"
 tamil_chola_navy_part_one_desc: "In the time of Rajaraja I, the Cholas grew from being a small force in the southeast to being a grand empire the likes of which few if any of the time could imagine. His efforts to reform the Chola military and navy were successful, so much so that he launched expeditions even toward the Malay Peninsula in the east. If we are to be as great as Rajaraja I in the future, we will need to pursue a consistent build up of our navy through new ship designs, functional docks and shipyards, and also through attracting captains and admirals who are well versed in naval matters."
 tamil_chola_navy_part_two_title: "Tamil Power Projection"
 tamil_chola_navy_part_two_desc: "Our initial steps at reforming our fleet of ships has proved succesful! We have a great amount of sailors at the ready and admirals and captains ready to lead our ships into battle, or off into new trade regions. Let us never take a moment of rest in refining our naval capabilities and be like our ancestors of the Chola dynasty, projecting our power ever further outward and toward new domains!"
 tamil_orissas_old_domain_title: "Overtake Orissa"
 tamil_orissas_old_domain_desc: "There is lucrative trade to be had along the coasts of what the Gajapati Kingdom (Orissa) held, but the domain of the Gajapati Kingdom was not limited to the coast. The inland tribes, those of the Gonds, the Garjats, and the Jharkhandi were subjugated by Kapilendra Deva, but has their power stayed all throughout this time? We will only find out when we take them on for hegemony of the profitable eastern coasts and the strategically valuable inland villages and towns."
 tamil_clean_up_bahmanis_title: "Petty Khans and Sultans"
 tamil_clean_up_bahmanis_desc: "The collapse of Muslim authority coming from Bidar has shaken up politics just to the north. There are some who think that because the Tamils of Tamilakam have effectively destroyed the Sultanate of Bahmanis, they can proclaim independence and grow in power, but they are mistaken. We will not have such petty threats to our authority on our border to the north, they must be subjugated by us without hesitation!"
 tamil_taking_gujarat_title: "Revoke Gujarati Power"
 tamil_taking_gujarat_desc: "Trade rights throught the western waters is valuable and often times various states skirmish with each other for more lucrative trading rights. Those of Gujarat have naturally held a great deal of trade rights since the 'Hajj Port' grants the region a great deal of commerce and immigrants. For too long have we let the Gujarati people stay in the dominant trade position they are in; now we must rectify things and forcibly revoke their power."
 tamil_indus_estuary_power_title: "Seize the Indus Estuary"
 tamil_indus_estuary_power_desc: "The last bastion on the subcontinent's western side that remains out of our control is that of the Indus River's estuary. It may not be as lucrative as the Hajj Port once controlled by the sultans of Gujarat, but it is useful as a port of trade and for our ships. From there, we can extend our trading capacity westward toward the coasts of Hormuz, Basra, and many other places that have goods we most certainly want to have. Conducting this successfully will make us a truly unmatched power in all of India."
 tamil_vindhyan_campaign_title: "Operation: Vikramaditya"
 tamil_vindhyan_campaign_desc: "Ujjain, one of the holiest cities to Hindus across the subcontinent and plundered by the Delhi Sultanate in the early 1200s; the once glorious capital of the legendary emperor Vikramaditya was sacked and burned without remorse. The destroying of the temples in Ujjain and the subsequent rise of Muslim power in and around Ujjain has been a cause for pain for many faithful Hindu people, but the Tamils are on the verge of restoring it to its former glory. We have the power to dethrone any would-be sultan or nawab throughout the subcontinent, so let us use this power to push north toward Ujjain and ever closer to the heart of where these Muslims conquests stemmed from in the past."
 tamil_commanding_bengali_trade_title: "The Pride of Bengal"
 tamil_commanding_bengali_trade_desc: "Bengal was once the home of the mighty Pala Empire, the last great Buddhist empire on the subcontinent. Now it houses sultans and rajas alike, all who think they deserve control of the immensely valuable Bengal Delta. They may fight it out for decades, but Tamils know that they are just bickering over primitive trade practices and broken deals; only we know how to truly obtain the most of trade in such a valuable region. In order to get to that point though, we do need to subdue and take over the lands of the Bengali region, which is easier said than done."
 tamil_final_rush_title: "The Heart of Darkness"
 tamil_final_rush_desc: "Long have Hindus suffered because of what was cultivated in the city of Delhi. From the conquests in the late 1100s by ambitious Muslims just past the Khyber Pass in the northwest, Delhi has played a foundational role in setting up Muslim authority all across parts of the subcontinent. That power has reached as far as Gujarati ports and Bengali shores, Deccani towns and even Tamil grounds. The southernmost victims of these conquests and raids, however, are now back and ready to banish the great darkness that has been spilling out without end from Delhi. No longer will there be a sultan of Delhi to threaten Hindus across the subcontinent."
 tamil_rajput_land_title: "North vs. South"
 tamil_rajput_land_desc: "With our position in Gujarat secured, the threats in Rajputana are something we need to take seriously. The centers of power at Chittor and a few others places are what our main goals should be initially, but if we wish for a lasting peace to be made in the land, we must understand their martial heritage on a deeper level. If we can do this and display our own martial skills to the rajputs confidently, we will be able to integrate them much more easily."
 tamil_eastern_bengali_trade_title: "Buddhist Trade Wars"
 tamil_eastern_bengali_trade_desc: "Past the lucrative shores of the Bengal Delta are the tropical shores of the Burmese and their kin. We are somewhat familiar with them, but not nearly as much as the Benagli merchants and people are since there have been multiple trade disputes over the decades. Buddhist powers struggled against the sultans of Bengal in the past, but now that Hindus rightfully control the Bengali region once again, we can bring an end to these Buddhist incursions and slowly begin to reforge the eastern conquests done by the Chola dynasty centuries in the past."
 tamil_somali_extension_title: "Seize the Somali Markets"
 tamil_somali_extension_desc: "Our initial incursion into the Somali trade sphere has been successful so far, but we're lacking in support in many coastal cities. Somali merchants and local leaders are working toward expelling Tamil merchants and ships from their harbors, but we're going to make sure that our people stay right where they are. Somali markets are lucrative to the point of many people wanting them subdued for their own purposes; we'd be foolish to let them slip out of our hands."
 tamil_control_south_arabia_title: "Willing Trade Partners"
 tamil_control_south_arabia_desc: "Divisions in South Arabian communities has led to us being able to make a firm landing, but we the valuable markets along the southern coast that trade in various types of incense and crops should be enough of a reason for Tamil sailors and soldiers to be vying for more land. If we can secure the whole of South Arabia and start controlling the productive parts of the arid landscape, money will hardly be a problem for us in the future."
 tamil_reestablish_sangams_title: "The Tamil Sangams"
 tamil_reestablish_sangams_desc: "Long ago, the Tamil legends thrived as if they were the gods and goddesses conversing and living alongside people like ourselves. The First, Second, and Third Sangams, the effective progenitors and starters of Tamil literature, are among these Tamil legends, but the Third Sangam is more than just a legend; it was real! From all over the lands of the Tamils, poets and scholars alike gathered in what we know of as Madurai to work on literature and texts for future generations and readers. Perhaps now that we have united the Tamils as a whole, we can see a rebirth of this hallowed tradition?"
 tamil_sumatra_and_kedah_title: "Footsteps of the Cholas"
 tamil_sumatra_and_kedah_desc: "The echoes of the past are heard more loudly than ever now. With our incursions eastward toward the Malay Peninsula and toward the Strait of Malacca, we are truly following in the footsteps of the Chola Empire and what miraculous conquests the Chola dynasty carried out. From Rajaraja I in the late 900s to Kulothunga I in the late 1000s, we must continue down this path of retracing the conquests of old and securing the old domains of the Chola Empire under one administration. Our next targets? Kedah and Northern Sumatra."
 tamil_lower_burma_title: "Lower Burma's Value"
 tamil_lower_burma_desc: "The mouth of the Irrawaddy River in Lower Burma is a haven for both crop growth and trade ports. Indian people of various families and regions have long since been around Lower Burma for mercantile purposes, but not only this, they've been around Lower Burma for conquest too. The Chola dynasty's legacy of conquest is strong within Tamilakam and we will be taking what is rightfully belonging to not only Tamils, but for Indians as a whole. From there, the entirety of the Burmese region will be opened up to us for trade, or for conquest."
 tamil_tropical_subjects_title: "Let the Spice Flow"
 tamil_tropical_subjects_desc: "The waters of South East Asia are fertile with monsoons and spices. Whilst we can predict when and where monsoons will strike usually, we cannot predict how the political entities of these various islands will act toward us as our influence grows toward them. It would be in our best interest to make subjects out of these far-flung states before taking on the lands they reside on in full."
 tamil_malaccan_power_title: "Strait Combat"
 tamil_malaccan_power_desc: "The battles for the Strait of Malacca are always fierce since everyone involved knows what is at stake: trade rights and potentially, trade hegemony. The Chola Empire of the past knew this as well and contested heavily for the strait, just as we will with the might of our grand fleet and the thunderous march of our seasoned soldiers."
 tamil_the_last_stop_title: "The Final Frontier"
 tamil_the_last_stop_desc: "Legends tell of the Chola Empire sending forth an officer toward the east, a man named Sri Lumay. He did nto follow as was ordered and instead rebelled from the Chola Empire altogether, founding his own Rajahnate of Cebu. His small political entity, however, has seen tumultuous times as the archipelago he set up shop in is quite chaotic and unorganized. It is time we conquer this last frontier that the Chola Empire almost reached before retracting in reach; it is time to finish this fight."
 tamil_re_indianization_title: "Indianization"
 
 #Mysore Missions
 tamil_re_indianization_desc: "Long ago, Indian culture made its way toward South East Asia through merchants and warfare. Hinduism and Buddhism, both Indian at their heart, spread forth through the islands and tropical lands, and to go along with this, Indian culture imparted various ways of organizing royalty in society and also the writing systems of various people groups. Since the Tamils are the foremost holders of Tamil culture and other Indian cultures, we could be in a position to bring a sort of second age of Indianzation, albeit with a bit more force behind it."
 mysore_renovate_srirangapatna_fort_title: "Srirangapatna Fortress"
 mysore_renovate_srirangapatna_fort_desc: "It is by no means a small fortress, but it is one that could do with some fixing up. If Mysore is to be protected from attacks in the future from places like the City of Victory and from Kerala, renovating and improving the Srirangapatna Fortress is an absolute must."
 mysore_first_alliances_title: "Extend a Friendly Hand"
 mysore_first_alliances_desc: "The situation is rather dire for Mysore as it stands. The Vijayanagara Empire, mighty as it is, seeks out hegemony over the Deccan and South India so that it may continue its glorious rise to prominence. Mysore is directly in that path, however, and so are many other states that line the coast and inland parts of the Deccan. It would be beneficial for us to reach out to these states and form a mutually beneficial alliance so that the Vijayanagara Empire is not able to projects its power so easily."
 mysore_our_home_area_title: "Restore our Heart"
 mysore_our_home_area_desc: "The central part of Mysore is in it of itself divided. What we traditionally know as the 'area of Mysore' is divided between the Vijayangara Empire and well, us, meaning that our current state is just a mere faction of its whole self. This cannot stand and we cannot remain separated like this; we must prepare ourselves and strike with our allies toward the Vijayanagara Empire before they become too powerful."
 mysore_kongu_memories_title: "Follow the Kaveri River"
 mysore_kongu_memories_desc: "Southward, toward the jungles of Kerala and toward the well known city of Madurai, Mysore's influence is somewhat known. Whilst we do not directly control this region, the area directly to our south known as Kongu is somewhat loyal to us whilst still being part of the Vijayangara Empire mostly. If we can manage to win a war against the mighty Hindu empire and secure Kongu as a whole, our pathway to being a South Indian power will be all the more clear."
 mysore_instability_of_the_ummatur_title: "Come Burning Down"
 mysore_instability_of_the_ummatur_desc: "Instability, lacking legitimacy, and struggling to keep up with internal politics... It is all weighing Mysore down to the point of being extremely vulnerable to outside forces. The fires are slowly rising, eating away at the foundations of our state and causing internal havoc throughout the land. We are either going to be entering a new age of turmoil to see a field of glory on the other side, or we are going to ride this instability out until its very end."
 mysore_access_to_the_coast_title: "Kolathiri, or Samoothiri?"
 mysore_access_to_the_coast_desc: "The splendid and wealthy states along India's southwest coast, the coast of Kerala, are fierce in their fights to maintain independence from various outside influences, but what they have in fighting ability they lack in unity across the wealthy coastline. Our two closest neighbors, the Kolathiri Dynasty of Kolathunadu and the Samoothiri of Calicut, are viable options for subjugation and expansion, but if we leave them in any sort of autonomous power, they will surely seek outside aid against us. Let us be swift and tactical with our annexation and cultivation of our initial access to the coast."
 mysore_end_vijayangars_heart_title: "Supersede the Sangamas"
 mysore_end_vijayangars_heart_desc: "For far too long, the Vijayanagara Empire and its Sangama Dynasty has ruled over a majority of South India. The power of the once grand dynasty is now fading, withering away bit by bit and succumbing to rising powers like us. Let us seize the venerable city that is at their heart, the City of Victory, and proclaim ourselves as the new authority for all of Southern India."
 mysore_firearms_for_mysoreans_title: "Questions of Black Powder"
 mysore_firearms_for_mysoreans_desc: "Mysore has is going to need to adapt to the coming times of warfare, that is true no matter what, but how Mysore becomes acquainted with and used to firearms both big and small is something that needs to be discussed in full. Advocates on one said espouse letting any Mysorean above a certain age access to these weapons, whereas advocates on another side advocate for only the military being allowed access to these weapons of war. Which side should we strive for here?"
 mysore_start_of_kannada_patronage_title: "A Mind for Literature"
 mysore_start_of_kannada_patronage_desc: "Kannada literature has been patronized at length and with great amounts of funding in the past. Grand writers of both Hindu and Jain adherence helped put together the Classical Period of Kannada Literature together prior to the 14th century, but with the Vijayanagara Empire in decline, who will take the place as the foremost patron and promoter of Kannada literary culture? Why, it will be none other than Mysore of course! And we will start with the Brahmins of our land, promoting the work they do in both the administration and in scholarly sectors."
 mysore_start_manufacturing_title: "Manufacturing Time"
 mysore_start_manufacturing_desc: "With a firm grip on valuable land in the Kerala area and with sufficient funding coming in from trade and taxes, Mysore is slowly aligning itself toward a position of economic reform. It will be slow and tedious as the infrastructure in our main cities is somewhat lacking, but by taking in advice from our financiers and engineers, we can plan out how our cities will expand with new buildings and eventually chart out how our economy will grow into the near future."
 mysore_filled_and_loyal_court_title: "A Mind for Politics"
 mysore_filled_and_loyal_court_desc: "The political game inside of Mysore is not always easy to navigate, any top official whether they are religious, military, or administrative in their orientation can tell you this with certainty. Regardless of the consistent internal shifting pieces we must deal with, we need to consistently work toward a more stable and successful functioning state through securing ties with local leaders and procuring good and loyal advisors. We should not be too hasty in our quest to do this though, as rushing things might bring more instability than we can handle."
 mysore_south_indian_domination_title: "The Fate of the South"
 mysore_south_indian_domination_desc: "With our push into the heart of Kongu now met with success and our military prepared to take on more daunting threats, we should turn our attention to the lucrative and important cities near the subcontinent's southern edge, before branching off into Lanka. Places like Madurai, Venad, and Tanjore are hubs of Tamil power and subsequentely resistance to Mysorean authority. We will need to conquer these strongholds one by one to ensure our southern front is never in danger, and to also secure ourselves lucrative new trade opportunities."
 mysore_iron_cased_rockets_title: "Rocket Regiments"
 mysore_iron_cased_rockets_desc: "The adaptation of muskets and cannons into Mysorean ranks is allowing our forces to compete with other states on a more equal playing field. New developments in rocket technology have been streaming into Mysore's military ranks and some are thinking they may just be the thing that can give our armies a distinctive edge in battle. If we can organize our regiments and effectively integrate them with rockets as a regular weapon of choice, we'll be ready to take on any military force in the world."
 mysore_fortified_from_invasion_title: "Stalwart Defenses"
 mysore_fortified_from_invasion_desc: "The fortifications in Mysore are great in some instances, the Srirangapatna Fortress being one them, but in other instances we are sorely lacking in defensive structures. The more of them we can build, whether they're situated on the coast or placed inland, the better off Mysore will be in terms of both military potential and defensive posturing."
 mysore_fight_off_european_influence_title: "Intruders from Afar"
 mysore_fight_off_european_influence_desc: "Slowly they come through, from the west toward the east in search of spices and land for themselves. Europeans are becoming more corageous and bold in their endeavors to take control of lands they deem valuable. South India is one of the places where they are seeking to gain a foothold so we must strive to defend it to the greatest possible degree."
 mysore_inroads_to_the_deccan_title: "Take Aim to our North"
 mysore_inroads_to_the_deccan_desc: "It seems we are finally make a name for ourselves, huh? Mysore is blossoming into a beautiful power the likes of which few in the past could ever achieve, but we are not done yet! To our north, in the Deccan, there are petty nawabs and rajas that seek to hold out against Mysore's rise to prominence. We need to show them that a new age is upon the subcontinent and that age is dominated by Mysore; we will demonstrate this be seizing the heart of the once famed and powerful Sultanate of Bahmanis."
 mysore_fortify_the_krishna_title: "The Wall of Krishna"
 mysore_fortify_the_krishna_desc: "Though the Krishna River provides a great amount of irrigation across the heart of the Deccan, we are wary of how it has been a marker of where invaders have crossed over to South India, and where others have also been stopped at in the past. Mysore's heartland in the south has the Srirangapatna Fortress protecting its north, but beyond that, fortifications are sparse across the landscape. Perhaps if we of Mysore make a chain of fortifications along the banks of the Krishna River and fortify it effectively, we can have it (the river) act like a hard stopping point for invaders before they ever reach southward toward Mysore itself."
 mysore_reformed_silk_production_title: "Textile Reformation"
 mysore_reformed_silk_production_desc: "The agrarian ways of Mysore are slowly being disrupted by the advent of trade from around the world. Demands are shifting, new ideas are coming to Mysorean lands, and the way we have done agriculture and the production of various goods is becoming outdated. To keep up with both the increasing demands of friendly trade partners and to bolster our own economy alongside others in the world, we should focus on developing proper places of dedicated to the production of certain resources and goods with new and innovative methods."
 mysore_education_and_theatrics_title: "A Mind for Mysore"
 mysore_education_and_theatrics_desc: "To think of Mysore in a simplistic manner of just being an administrative sector, a military sector, a diplomatic sector, and a peasant class would get you nowhere. Mysore, much like every other state around us, is a complex web of connections all working together to uphold the grandeur that is our functioning state. As time goes on, we are encountering new and bold ideas that challenge our traditions and we can't just stave them off; traders and diplomats alike bring them when they travel to our lands. Instead, we should begin to work with these ideas and attempt to integrate them into our culture and wider society through education and other means."
 WALL_OF_KRISHNA: "§GFortifications along the Krishna River will have excellent communication and coordination abilities, allowing for an effective defensive barrier between the Mysorean heartland in the south and the rest of the subcontinent.§"
 mysore_subjugate_marathi_people_title: "Mysore vs Maharashtra"
 mysore_subjugate_marathi_people_desc: "The Marathi people have a rich legacy of empires and kingdoms from the past like other cultures that are found throughout the subcontinent. They are hard to tame and often can help make or break the power of various leaders across the Deccan, but we of Mysore are different. We will learn from those who failed to subjugate the Marathi people in the past and take a more skillful and measured approach to integration. That is, after we firmly invade and annex the lands the Marathi call home: that which is known as Maharashtra."
 mysore_deccan_domination_title: "More than Mahisha Mandala"
 mysore_deccan_domination_desc: "Kannada culture stretches back centuries and its various kingdoms and empires all left a distinct mark on Kannada culture through lifting and lowering various dynasties, evolving the language itself, helping contribute to the scholarly works written throughout the centuries, and even how Hinduism, Islam, and Jainism is practiced. Even Mysore itself was called Mahisha Mandala in ancient times, referring to a mythological demon named Mahishasura, yet we are much more than those myths ever told of. What these various political entites that perpetuated Kannad culture in the past failed to do, however, is secure their continued existence thanks to a number of factors. Mysore will not be like those past polities, no, it will be in essence a culmination of those past efforts into one exalted and noble empire that likes of which the subcontinent has yet to see. We are and truly will be finest empire yet that expresses Kannada culture in its most pristine form."
 mysore_monopolize_trade_title: "Monopolisitic Maneuvers"
 mysore_monopolize_trade_desc: "With how much we are investing into production and infrastructure in the bustling coastal and inland cities of Mysore, it should come as no surprise that we are raking in a lot of money through trade and production. We are actually in a position to completely dominate whole trade sectors across the subcontinent, we just simply need to push ourselves a little bit harder. Annexing a few more pieces of land and building some more manufacturing centers will surely bring total trade hegemony to Mysore in the coming years."

 deccani_five_cities_five_successors_title: "Five Cities - Five States"
 deccani_five_cities_five_successors_desc: "Ever since the collapse of the Sultanate of Bahmanis, we have been left to struggle and fight for an existence that seems almost doomed at times. We are not alone in this though, as there are other cities in the former Deccani state that have gained prominence and power amidst the collapse.\nAhmednagar, Berar, Bijapur, and Golconda, all have aspirations for reuniting the lands of Bahmanis into one whole state and the city of Bidar itself is also trying to make itself a standing political figure still. We must not delay our conquest nor become stagnant in this quickly shifting political climate; we must steady ourselves and strike when the times are right so that our safety and power is secured."
 deccani_the_battle_of_talikota_title: "Bulwark of the Deccan"
 deccani_the_battle_of_talikota_desc: "The largest threat to us as of now is the Hindu powers to the south, most notably the Vijayanagara Empire. Though the power of the Sultanate of Bahmanis is but a memory now, with the consolidation of the five key cities of the Deccan under our authority we can effectively push back the Hindu encroachment from the south. The legacy of our predecessor will not be tarnished so easily!"
 deccani_khandesh_and_vijayangara_title: "The Deccani Wars"
 deccani_khandesh_and_vijayangara_desc: "There is much to be gained through conquering the Deccan and its lucrative cities, bountiful fields, and productive mines. We are not alone in seeing this, however, as those in the north and south are still willing to challenge our hegemony over the region as a whole. Let us draw our sword and meet these foes in battle for we will have to wage not just one single war to win over what is rightfully ours, but multiple wars that will dictate the very future of our empire and the fate of millions of people on the subcontinent."
 deccani_unite_the_region_title: "Nizam-ul-Mulk"
 deccani_unite_the_region_desc: "What it means to be a good Nizam (roughly meaning 'governor') and leader of the Deccan is hard to nail down. So many facets are required to be a competent administrator alone, but the challenges of the Deccan such as cultural clashes and religious confluences make it so that a truly benevolent and just Nizam-ul-Mulk (roughly meaning 'Governor of the Realm') will be hard to come by. We must never cease in our endeavor to make this happen though, since controlling the entirety of the Deccan will challenge our administration and its primary leadership time and time again. Truly we must look toward building a stable and prosperous future under a rightful Nizam."
 deccani_chowmahalla_palace_title: "Chowmahalla Palace"
 deccani_chowmahalla_palace_desc: "With our conquests throughout the Deccan complete and our military still embarking on conquests in neighboring regions, there are some within our dynasty and administration who think it would do us well to have a proper seat of residence. One of the most nominated candidate cities for this is near Golconda. Now, Golconda is prosperous and valuable of course, but the burgeoning city of Hyderabad nearby does not experience as many water shortages and as such would be a fitting place for a new palace of great detail and prestige. In time, as we plan out this new palace for our dynasty, we can formulate it into an administrative center of sorts, but that will only be in conjunction with it being the crowning achievement to our long line of conquests."

 bijapur_seperate_but_allies_desc: "The various shattered parts of the once glorious Sultanate of Bahmanis are all fighting for power and the vultures to the north and south are striving for every inch of ground they can get in the Deccan. We need to be quick to make friends and allies with other powers if we are to secure Bijapur's safety for the coming few years; if we are stuck without any help at all, we will surely be destroyed without mercy."
 bijapur_shifting_markets_title: "The Bijapuri Rebound"
 bijapur_shifting_markets_desc: "The economy of Bijapur as a city unto itself took a substanial hit in revenue when we broke off from the declining Sultanate of Bahmanis, but our economy was not permanently cut down. By building new market districts and focusing our efforts on promoting the growth of our capital, we will be able to recover quickly and sufficiently."
 bijapur_sufi_connections_title: "The Sufis of Bijapur"
 bijapur_sufi_connections_desc: "Long have Sufis streamed into the Deccan from the various parts of Arabia and Persia. They have been a common part of various communities all the way from Multan to Delhi and even toward Bidar itself since sultans of various time periods needed them to help maintain order and slowly spread Islam whenever they could. We of Bijapur are no different in this respect and should strive to maintain religious harmony inside our own borders with the help of Sufis of various orders."
 bijapur_solidify_the_economy_title: "Markets & Mosques"
 bijapur_solidify_the_economy_desc: "The start of our economic rebound is set and we are well on the way to making sizable profits again, but we are not out of the woods yet. Administrators and military officials need a more steady revenue stream from multiple cities, not just Bijapur itself despite how good it is doing. Promoting growth through building mosques and new markets in surrounding areas will help accomplish this goal and help fund our growing state."
 bijapur_a_protected_capital_title: "The Bijapur Fort"
 bijapur_a_protected_capital_desc: "Whilst the markets of our capital are growing in greatly, we are left to wonder about how our capital will fare when roaming enemy armies come to try and capture it. Sure there are basic defensive structures in the city and at the edge of its perimeter, but leaving it without a proper fortress of some kind is simply too much of a risk. We can do more to protect our grand capital and help it grow in a more safe environment."

 bijapur_gol_gumbaz_and_jama_masjid_desc: "To honor those of our lineage and to honor Islam itself, we should be embarking on architectural plans for grand structures. Mausoleums and mosques are a basic concept indeed, but we of Bijapur have the capability and creativity to build more intricate and unique mausoleums and mosques complete with architecture and details that we want to see. The first of these great mausoleums shall be proclaimed as 'Gol Gumbaz', and the first of these great mosques shall be proclaimed as 'Jama Masjid', both of which will set us on a path of prestige and granduer."
 bijapur_malik_i_maidan_cannon_title: "Master of the Field"
 bijapur_malik_i_maidan_cannon_desc: "The world continues to change slowly around us on the person-to-person level, but on the level of the military and the administration, things change at a fairly regular pace. Bijapur as a state cannot be sit idly by as things in warfare continue to evolve especialy with gunpowder weapons both large and small being refined consistently. If we can amass enough cannons for our military and integrate them effectively into our strategies that we use on the field of battle, we'll become ever more masterful of how warfare is conducted."
 bijapur_prospects_in_golconda_title: "Guiding Golconda"
 bijapur_prospects_in_golconda_desc: "Perhaps the most abundant reason why Golconda is such a rich and prosperous place is because of the valuable diamonds and other gems taken out of the earth from its various mines. This prosperity was not only enough to bring Golconda to prominence, but it also brought forth the businesses of textile making, the refinement of metal ores, and also the trade in spices. Who are we of Bijapur to deny Golconda this prosperity? If Bijapur can be one economic hub of the Deccan, Golconda can be another!"
 bijapur_worthy_subjects_title: "Like Father Like Son"
 bijapur_worthy_subjects_desc: "We are very much like the child of the Sultanate of Bahmanis, and the Sultanate of Bahmanis was very much like its predecessor, the Delhi Sultanate: both of our predecessors made their mark on the land through gaining power through conquest, but that was not the only way they did so. Often times they held other states as a subject of the larger sultanate itself, exacting tribute and loyalty from subject rajas and princes so that they could more effectively project power. We of Bijapur are no exception in how we will need to project our power outward, so acquiring subject states should be something we get around to."
 bijapur_military_unison_title: "Standing Army Initiative"
 bijapur_military_unison_desc: "Though we are powerful and we have made our name known throughout the subcontinent, we are still lacking in a sufficiently centralized military system that has key facets like regulated payments, military academies, and distinct ranks for soldiers to ascend to. If we can instill enough discipline into our soldiers and bring forth the best military minds that Bijapur has to offer to the forefront, then we can initiate a centralization process that would culminate in a strong and effective standing army that all of Bijapur can depend upon."
 bijapur_quell_the_marathas_title: "Marathi Questions"
 bijapur_quell_the_marathas_desc: "The Marathi people are integral to Bijapur and all of the Deccan as a region. They have been around for as long as almost any other group on the subcontinent and though they may not hold as much power as they did in centuries past, they are still very influential on the local level in Bijapur. We need to win over their loyalty completely and ensure that their is very little in the way of rebellious sentiment among Marathi communities so that we can have a much more cohesive and prosperous homeland."
 bijapur_markets_and_workshops_title: "Prosperous Heights"
 bijapur_markets_and_workshops_desc: "Our great attention to economic matters and how our revenue is taken in has given Bijapur a new life of grandeur and grace, but our work is still not yet done. In cities surrounding Bijapur, such as Gulbarga, they lack the proper infrastructure and functional buildings that Bijapur does to make profits and produce materials and resources on the levels of Bijapur itself. Investing more money into adjacent cities and other places around our state will undoubtedly serve to enhance how much we bring in on not only a yearly basis, but a monthly basis as well."
 bijapur_education_and_grandeur_title: "Palmyra of the Deccan"
 bijapur_education_and_grandeur_desc: "With so much work being done to uphold Bijapur as the center of the Deccan, it is no wonder why artists, musicians, poets, and scholars all come to Bijapur from across the subcontinent and from beyond its shores. Our reputation is almost unmatched with how glorious our capital is and we should only be looking upward toward what else we can do to elevate it higher. The next step for us is to promote education throughout Bijapur whilst also retaining the prestige we've attracted over the decades, for universities and a lively court will certainly keep Bijapur at the forefront of the world."
 MARATHI_LOYALTY: "No owned provinces of Marathi culture has more than 2 unrest or 30% local autonomy."
 bijapur_utilize_the_raichur_doab_title: "Reconstruction in Raichur"
 bijapur_utilize_the_raichur_doab_desc: "The Raichur Doab is in need of attention after we have taken it over recently. It is home to plentiful fields that provide men and women with food as well other resources, but the recent wars in the Deccan have strained the region to its limit almost. Let us tend to these cities and fields carefully, promote construction efforts where they are needed, and see to it that we cement a strong foundation for Bijapur in these lands."
 
 #Golconda Missions
 golconda_advised_where_to_go_title: "The Paths Ahead"
 golconda_advised_where_to_go_desc: "Golconda is at a crossroads: What path should we pursue? Conquest of our neighbors to grow our borders? Building projects for our many towns and cities? Or possibly even diplomatic endeavors for good alliances in the future? All of these possibilities are hard to process for just one singular head of Golconda's administration, which is why advisors will need to be employed regularly so that they can help decipher what path for Golconda is best. Their advice could very well lead Golconda into prosperous times and we should always be aiming for that."
 golconda_starting_builds_title: "Internal Spending"
 golconda_starting_builds_desc: "Our position as the inheritor of the lucrative mines of Golconda makes us valuable and coveted by many powers around us, but the wealth that is taken from deep within the dirt beneath us can be used to stop our enemies from taking over our lands. Sure we could do this through spending more on the military, but a more permanent solution would be something along the lines of promoting building projects so that tax revenue is increased and our cities become larger overall. A larger population pool to draw on and a bigger stream of coins coming into the treasury will surely benefit Golconda's defense and offense whenever either are needed."
 golconda_take_the_andhra_coast_title: "Toward Andhra's Coast"
 golconda_take_the_andhra_coast_desc: "Telugu communities lay scattered across the various parts of the Eastern Deccan and toward the coastal edge of the subcontinent, just north of the Tamil areas in the south. If we of Golconda could unite most if not all of the Telugu communities into one cohesive state and administration, we would be in a position of substanial power in terms of both projecting military power and influence through trade. It seems quite obvious then what our next objective is."
 golconda_reserves_ready_title: "Test Your Mettle"
 golconda_reserves_ready_desc: "The descent of the Sultanate of Bahmanis into the annals of history is sad to many in Golconda, but we must not dwell on the death of our predecessor for too long. Disunified are the successors of Bahmanis, but in time there will be a singular successor to the sultans who hailed from Bidar. We of Golconda need to prepare our military for when we are put forth our claim to be the next in line for succession to the old Bahmani legacy."
 golconda_the_capital_fort_title: "Golconda's Citadel"
 golconda_the_capital_fort_desc: "Lucrative are our lands but we are lacking in what seems to be proper fortifications. What we have right now, a crude mudbrick capital wall, is not going to be enough against courageous invading armies wielding muskets and cannons alike. Let us garner military engineers and workers alike so that we can design a proper citadel in which our most valued officials and families can be safe inside whilst the garrison fights valiantly against any would-be invader."
 golconda_centralize_further_title: "Enforced Edicts"
 golconda_centralize_further_desc: "The many laws and edicts we pass in the capital can often go unheard of in far off parts of Golconda, especially in places where we would like them followed most of all such as trade hubs and port cities. We should focus our efforts on building up road networks to relay information across our lands more quickly, and also we should be installing smart yet obedient officials throughout Golconda so that our laws are enforced locally as well as seen to have adequate legitimacy."
 OWNS_ALL_TELUGU_PROVINCES_IN_ASIA: "§O[This.GetName] must own all provinces in India of Telugu culture.§!"
 golconda_all_telugu_lands_title: "Scattered Family"
 golconda_all_telugu_lands_desc: "Though we have a great many Telugu communities in our own lands, there are still several towns and cities in the lands southeast of the Deccan Plateau that speak the Telugu language and share in our cultural history. Though some would point out that we, the ruling body of Golconda, are of Persian origin just like the Sultanate of Bahmanis was, we embrace the Telugu language and culture to a great extent and even our royal family is educated in the beautiful language and traditions that stretch back centuries. With these righteous Muslims leading the charge, the time has finally come to reunite these scattered familial pieces into one singular political entity."
 golconda_prominent_capital_title: "Unprecedented Growth"
 golconda_prominent_capital_desc: "The influx of wealth and prosperity to Golconda has had a number of effects on both the administration and society as a whole, though these changes are slow to make themselves known on a large scale. We should stop these changes now though, and we certainly should not stop the growing prosperity making its way throughout our land. Centralizing this new wealth and prosperity in our capital city and also the growing city of Hyderabad (located very close to Golconda itself) will help stabilize this upward trend instead of letting it spiral out of control."
 golconda_starting_textile_production_title: "Meet the Demands"
 golconda_starting_textile_production_desc: "As we continue to grow and prosper throughout the years, we are becoming more connected with overseas markets and also markets that are beyond cities like Delhi, Multan, and Dhaka. These places, like our own heartland, are growing in size and density and are demanding more foreign goods like silk clothing and dyed cloth. We of Golconda are prominent producers of those two things nad also many other resources and we can continue to make great amounts of money from these foreign cities via trade if and only if we are able to meet the increasing demands."
 golconda_monuments_title: "Immortalized Self"
 golconda_monuments_desc: "We stand at the precipice of greatness. Our once small nation covered by the ashes of the once burning Sultanate of Bahmanis has grown into a monumental empire the likes of which few could have ever dreamed of in the midst of the early 1500s. To complete our rise to prominence and to decorate our already illustrious crown, we shall begin constructing monuments to our own empire. Whether they are mosques, gardens, or tombs for our hallowed royal lineage, all of these delightfully prestigious structures we build will show our might and grandeur to the world at large."
 golconda_composite_state_title: "Composite State"
 golconda_composite_state_desc: "Being that we are situated in the vast subcontinent of Hindustan where Muslims are more of a ruling minority instead of a true majority like in Arabia or Persia, we must make compromises with Hindu locals when we govern and we must learn to be much more tolerant as time goes on. By incorporating more Hindus into our administration, respecting their rights when it comes to various ceremonies and places of worship, and treating them as equals throughout Golconda, we can cultivate state that can be described as 'composite' in nature. Golconda will truly become greater than the sum of its original parts."
 golconda_patronize_telugu_culture_title: "Open a New Chapter"
 golconda_patronize_telugu_culture_desc: "The sun has set on the previous period of Telugu literature being promoted by the old Vijayanagara Empire. Now the Telugu people are looking to Golconda and its administration for assistance in starting a new age of Telugu literature as many poets and scholars of Telugu heritage are beginning to make themselves known in our land. If we can prove to be stable enough and also wealthy enough to fund a grand and varied court structure, then Golconda can indeed become the new center of Telugu literature. We will also promote Persian literature as well in our court, but the Telugu people are our core people and deserve this renewed time in the sun."
 
 #Ahmednagar Missions
 ahmed_not_done_fighting_title: "Another Shot Rings Out"
 ahmed_not_done_fighting_desc: "Just when we sit down to rest our heels and our heads, another arrows flies past us! Another musket fires! And another cannon sounds off in the distance! Is there ever any peace in the Deccan after the fall of the once great Sultanate of Bahmanis? It seems not, and our birth in the fires of rebellion was only the start of our troubles. Let us prepare for upcoming wars by enlisting the finest officers in Ahmednagar and the royal family, for the troubles ahead will require all of us to pitch in together."
 ahmed_warriors_do_read_books_title: "Military Literature"
 ahmed_warriors_do_read_books_desc: "Just as our military grows, so to do their needs in a variety of areas. One thing that is rare to see though is a warrior of Ahmednagar reading in their spare time, whether it is a book on military matters, vedic literature, or simple collections of poems and scripture. With the increasing number of military works and papers being written up and circulated in the upper echelons of our administration, perhaps we should start giving our officers and common warriors a few good military reads in their spare time so that they aren't wandering about in search of something to do."
 ahmed_army_compounds_title: "Armories and Barracks"
 ahmed_army_compounds_desc: "Preparing a proper fighting force is a key part for any rising state in this age. The Sultanate of Bahmanis may have laid the foundations for this before us, but we of Ahmednagar will build upwards from where they left off and cultivate proper infrastructure for our military so that they do not infringe too heavily on the peasant population. From armories to barracks and training fields, our rank and file soldiers will never be caught unprepared in our own land."
 ahmed_stop_court_intrigue_title: "No Cloak, No Dagger"
 ahmed_stop_court_intrigue_desc: "The court of a new state can often be a volatile place where deception, intrigue, and power politics all play a role in deciding who lives and who dies. Ahmednagar is no stranger to these deadly games and the court has been riddled with bodies of pretenders in the past, which is why we need to ensure that our advisors and family are as loyal as they can be. Working on reducing corrupt ties and instilling a good image of the royal dynasty amongst prominent nobles should be a good first step for us."
 ahmed_survey_the_land_title: "Revisions and Reforms"
 ahmed_survey_the_land_desc: "Old traditions meet new legislation in Ahmednagar as we are trying to sort out which laws to keep in our books and which laws should be either discarded altogether or revised to a certain degree. Whilst this is going on, we will need to actually organize the construction of certain facilities to help with work on the land we are currently trying to govern so that we are not stuck with unproductive layabouts when the laws are done being passed and recorded."
 ahmed_school_of_architecture_title: "Monumental Aspirations"
 ahmed_school_of_architecture_desc: "As our land is becoming utilized by more and more Marathi, Kannada, and Gujarati people, we should be looking at how we can effectively plan out the construction of new buildings in our most developed cities. Not only this, but putting the effort in to detail the buildings with various styles of our heritage is also a goal that we have. If we can successfully start up a few schools of engineering and construction to train specialized workers for this field, Ahmednagar will soon become a land blossoming with beautiful monuments and functional buildings."
 ahmed_school_of_art_title: "Coloring the Sultanate"
 ahmed_school_of_art_desc: "There is little in the way of true artistic color flowing out of the court and schools of Ahmednagar. Artists and sculptors are so few and far between that some say there is very little in the way of beauty in the lands of Ahmednagar; it is merely a land of soldiers, nobles, and peasants. We must work to change this at once and bolster our prestige in the eyes of not only foreigners but also those inside of our realm, for, the legacy of the Sultanate of Bahmanis does run in our blood. They too patronized artistry to a degree and we should rightfully pick up where they left off."
 ahmed_ample_forces_ready_title: "Offense and Defense"
 ahmed_ample_forces_ready_desc: "It is not easy to field great armies of tens of thousands of soldiers since our state is still growing, but we are gaining traction in the Deccan as time goes on. Our cities are slowly producing more taxes, our armories are slowly getting their methods of production in line, and soon enough our military will be in a much more refined state so that we of Ahmednagar are ready to conquer any state that opposes us. We just need to make sure we have the men to supply our growing military, lest we collapse in the midst of war."
 ahmed_exuding_power_title: "A Diplomatic Tone"
 ahmed_exuding_power_desc: "Whilst we endeavor to strengthen our military in all possible ways we can afford, we must not neglect to handle subject states well. Military subject states on the frontier and near the edge of Ahmednagari control should be paying fealty and money to us regularly so that we can exude more power outwards. And if these petty rajas and emirs get upset with us over their taxation and military requirements? We will have a dialogue with them at first instead of resorting to pure military reprisals."
 ahmed_tombs_of_the_giants_title: "Venerable Tombs"
 ahmed_tombs_of_the_giants_desc: "With architects and artists at the ready, we should now look to honoring our ancestors and those who died in the founding of Ahmednagar. Many good men and women lost their lives in the struggles of the past, and as we move forward without fear we must also realize that other great people of Ahmednagar will pass away too. Building righteous and beautiful tombs and reshaping parts of the landscape to fit these magnficient burial spots will do these heroes of our history justice."
 ahmed_coastal_access_title: "Rekindle the Coast"
 ahmed_coastal_access_desc: "The Habshi stream of indentured servants and slaves from East Africa to the subcontinent has been broken for some time now, leading to some places in the Deccan going into a state of crisis without the normal workforce they have relied on for decades. If we can take back the Konkan Ports and hold them for long enough so that Ahmednagari administrators can break through the local autonomy, then we will see a steady stream of Habshi people flow into the subcontinent again."
 ahmed_habshi_integration_title: "Trust in the Habshi"
 ahmed_habshi_integration_desc: "The Habshi people are becoming more integral to Ahmednagari society with each passing year. We see them building communities integrated with Kannada and Marathi people and even sharing regularly in festivities and jobs around the state. Allowing them to serve in the higher positions of our government would be the next step for them, would it not? They have earned our trust and thus will be rewarded properly, and we in turn will be stronger with them united behind the flag of Ahmednagar."
 ahmed_trade_leaning_west_title: "Routes to Gujarat"
 ahmed_trade_leaning_west_desc: "Ahmednagar was not inherently blessed with glorious gem mines like Golconda nor was it blessed with valuable trade routes toward the flat plains along the southeast of the subcontinent. We have had to instead utilize the routes that go through the hills and tropical lands of the northwest Deccan region that lead toward the Gujarat region. Strengthening these trade key routes and ensuring that our merchants are the dominant ones throughout the Deccan could lead to more growth throughout the land and even more people being attracted to our own capital city."
 ahmed_school_of_engineering_title: "Fortified Barriers"
 ahmed_school_of_engineering_desc: "Whilst we have worked to cultivate a stable court and also to promote a great deal of artistic splendor, we have not focused on the fortifications of our land in a very long while. The cannons used by besieging armies are getting stronger and more reliable with every passing war which means we are going to need knowledgable engineers who can help build up new walls and fortifications that can withstand future sieges. If we can attract artists and sculptors, then surely we can attract worthy engineers to our land."
 
 
 
 
 #Berar Missions
 berar_begin_the_mines_title: "More Copper Needed"
 berar_begin_the_mines_desc: "Our capital at Illichipur is quite poor in comparison to the likes of Bijapur, Bidar, and Golconda. The rougher terrain is not as easy to settle on, but the copper mines in and around our capital city make building on this land worth it. Whether it is used in weaponry or building material or some other regular usage, the copper flowing from Illichipur will fuel our upstart state."
 berar_in_the_fray_title: "A Spark to Ignite"
 berar_in_the_fray_desc: "The Sultanate of Bahmanis is in ruins but the nobles appointed to the five states are not lost! We of Berar, just like those of the other sultanates that broke away, can see just how tense politics are. A single move from someone in Deccan could trigger a cascade of conflicts coming forth, but who will make this first move? Whoever it may be, we need to ensure that our military is prepared in every possible way."
 berar_the_loyalty_at_home_title: "Satiate the Majority"
 berar_the_loyalty_at_home_desc: "As with all other sultanates in this grand subcontinent, we of Berar are a Muslim minority ruling over a Hindu majority. It is of no use attempting to enforce an orthodox and stringent view on Islam in Berar, therefore we must turn to working with Hindus and their spiritual caste, the Brahmins, to maintain order in the land. If we can work with the Brahmins effectively and integrate them into our royal court, Berar will be set for a prosperous future."
 berar_learned_family_title: "Books & Tomes"
 berar_learned_family_desc: "The integration of Hindu people into the admiministration of Berar has been a slow process, but one that is fruitful in what it brings. Books and tomes in the Kannada language as well as neighboring the Telugu and Marathi languages are slowly streaming into our royal court, allowing for greater insights into a plethora of subjects from natural science and poetry to military strategy and geography. Buying more of these books and encouraging our court to read these writings regularly would really help bring a more educated atmosphere to our court, would it not?"
