 tus_florentine_cloth_desc: "Florentine merchants were already beginning to enter the European trade circuit. Semi-finished cloths came from Flanders and France and the alum for dyeing from the Levant: with these the Florentines refined and dyed the fabrics until they turned them into precious fabrics that resold abroad at significantly increased prices."

Livorno was the seat of the Maritime Health Department with an important harbor master's office with jurisdiction over the entire Tuscan sea, including the islands.

 tus_studio_sapienza_desc: "Center of European culture for the entire Renaissance, the Grand Duchy inherited and developed its enormous artistic and intellectual heritage even in the following centuries, albeit in a more modest and circumscribed form. With the Lorraine the artistic activity is revived and a ruling class of Tuscan intellectuals is reconstituted which together with economic activity is the most conspicuous aspect of the state in the whole stagnant panorama of Italy. The university studies of "La Sapienza" of Pisa, famous for teaching law and of "Lo Studio" of Siena, are renewed and given back dignity, becoming the centers of the Tuscan and Italian enlightenment, while in Florence there is a note surgical school at Santa Maria Novella. From these centers of culture men such as Bernardo Tanucci, Leopoldo Andrea Guadagni, Claudio Fromond, Paolo Frisi, Antonio Cocchi, Leonardo Ximenes are formed."

 tus_nove_conservatori_desc: "The bad administration of the territory had generally rendered the already insufficient viability of Tuscany unusable, aggravated also by the phenomenon of banditry in the most remote areas of the state such as Val di Chiana and Maremma. Traced without planning, without regulations and maintenance, the Tuscan roads were in a state of semi-neglect, often resulting in simple paths barely visible to disappear into marshes or dust, interrupted by streams or fords without signs. Especially in the winter season they became largely impassable due to the rain."

 tus_monete_misure_title: "Monete e Misure"
 tus_monete_misure_desc: "The Tuscan monetary and measurement system was based on the very ancient duodecimal system of Etruscan-Roman origins. The currency par excellence was the Gold Florin, known and appreciated throughout Europe for its intrinsic golden value and the subject of numerous forgeries and imitations by other powers. Obviously, the exchange value of Tuscan coins changed over the centuries. At the time of the Italian unification, the basic currency of the grand duchy was the Tuscan or Florentine lira, equivalent to 84 cents of the Italian lira of the time. One Lira consisted of 20 Tuscan soldi. The mint was in Florence and Pisa. The units of measurement, referring to their medieval origins, in particular the agricultural ones, could vary from city to city, even if the Florentine ones became increasingly common."
 tus_armata_granducale_title: "Armata Granducale"
 tus_armata_granducale_desc: "After the long wars that led Florence to the annexation of much of today's Tuscany and with the last great war against Siena, the Medici and then Lorraine government maintained an army composed of a few units of mercenaries and veterans who often only carried out a internal control on the territory for the absolute absence of neighboring enemies, supporting the bargello and its brewers in the tasks of protecting public order. The only fortresses that continued to carry out a military and defensive importance were the strongholds of Livorno and Portoferraio for the safety of the sea and coasts, continually threatened by the Barbarian pirates of Maghreb and Turks."
 tus_conquest_of_rome_title: "Conquest of Rome"
 tus_conquest_of_rome_desc: "Founded according to tradition on April 21, 753 BC (although recent excavations in Lapis niger would date the foundation back to 2 centuries earlier), during its three millennia of history it was the first metropolis of humanity, the beating heart of one of the most important ancient civilizations, which influenced society, the culture, language, literature, art, architecture, philosophy, religion, law and customs of the following centuries. Place of origin of the Latin language, it was the capital of the Roman Empire which extended its dominion over the whole Mediterranean basin and most of Europe, the Papal States, subjected to the temporal power of the popes and the future Kingdom of Italy. By definition, Rome, Caput Mundi and Eternal City are defined. Its historic center, delimited by the perimeter of the Aurelian walls, overlapping of testimonies of almost three millennia, is an expression of the historical, artistic and cultural heritage of the western European world."

The Tuscan ships were reduced to small ships with Latin sail, where the presence of Tuscan sailors was minimal. Very popular were the lateen sail boats, used mainly for the transport of goods and food on the Arno up to the river port of Porto di Mezzo, near Lastra a Signa, while along the coasts for the small cabotage the tartana was in use and the leute owned by some Elban."

 tus_marine_saint_stefan_desc: "Thanks to the Order of Santo Stefano, the Grand Duchy was able to take advantage of its own military fleet since its constitution and to increase the sovereigns themselves. The headquarters of the fleet became the port of Livorno, which kept the galleys or stefanian galleys safe in its docks. Base of the Tuscan navy, Livorno was until the middle of the 18th century, the starting port of the racing war of the knights of Santo Stefano who in their annual "caravans" went to reciprocate the raids of Ottoman and Barbary corsairs."
 tus_strongholds_piracy_title: "Strongholds of Piracy"
 tus_strongholds_piracy_desc: "In 1159 Abd al-Mu'min, the founder of the Almohad dynasty, conquered Tunis, bringing a new government to the region. For Tunis it was a period of further development, which led it to become the first provincial capital, and capital of the kingdom in 1228, when the governor Abu Zakariyya took power and established the hafside dynasty. The conquest by the Almohads dates back to 1159 and the conquest by the hafside ruler Abu Zakarya Yahya in 1235. In 1302 the islet in front, called Penon, was occupied by the Castilians who made it the base for trade between the Kingdom of Tlemcen and the Iberian Peninsula. \nAnd now they are ours, the fall of the most important strongholds of the Berberic pirates has helped restoring peace in the Mediterranean sea a new age of Prosperity will finally arise alongside peace through these turbulent waters. Purification will mend the sins of those who inhabited the heathen cities."
