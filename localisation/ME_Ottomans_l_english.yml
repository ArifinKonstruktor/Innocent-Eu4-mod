 ME_TUR_Events.1.t: "Return of the Ghazi Sultan"
 ME_TUR_Events.1.d: "The Sultan Murad II, famed for the conquest of the Beyliks in Anatolia and the Kingdoms in the Balkans, led the Ottoman army to victory against the Christian Coalition at the Battle of Varna not long ago. It is said that he dismounted and fell to his knees and prayed mid-battle, something a legendary Caliph had done. The battle immediately turned in their favor. Murad II styled himself like this - a Ghazi King - strongly, as one meant to embody the virtues of an honest warrior. Despite that, he had grown tired of his nearly two decades of constant warfare, for he did not enjoy ruling from the throne or the responsibilities that went with it. He decided to abdicate the throne to his son, Mehmed II following the victory at Varna. Despite that he was only given short reprieve until a Janissary riot against Mehmed II had forced him to once again take the reins and lead again."
 ME_TUR_Events.1.a: "He shall lead."

 ME_TUR_Events.1.c: "Let him rest."

 ME_TUR_Events.2.t: "The Fall of Constantinople"
 ME_TUR_Events.2.d: "The lives of thousands of men and rule of many decades has all culminated in this event in our history. How much has been lost and how much gained for this small parcel of land? Regardless, the City of the World's Desire is now ours. We are not only on negotiating terms with the legendary Roman Empire, but on the demanding end. Amongst the flurry of activity surrounding the negotiations of surrender, [Root.Monarch.GetName] catches wind of roman pretenders quietly fleeing to Morea.\n\nHow shall we negotiate?"
 ME_TUR_Events.2.a: "Kill the Pretenders! It is Ours!"
 ME_TUR_Events.2.b: "They have already lost much today. Let them go."
 ME_TUR_Events.2.c: "Why take their Rome when we can make our own?"

 ME_TUR_Events.3.t: "The Annexation of [Root.GetName]"

 ME_TUR_Events.4.t: "The Annexation of [Root.GetName]"

 ME_TUR_Events.5.b: "He was a traitor, we should condemn him."

 ME_TUR_Events.6.t: "Displacement of the Karamanids"

 ME_TUR_Events.6.a: "Off they go!"
 ME_TUR_Events.6.b: "That seems unfair!"
 
 ME_TUR_Events.11.t: "Capitulation of the Mamluk Sultanate"
 ME_TUR_Events.11.d: "The extensive Mamluk Sultanate to the south has been a constant source of distress for our rule.

 ME_TUR_Events.9.a: "Finally!"
 
 ME_TUR_Events.10.t: "Liberation of Syria"
 ME_TUR_Events.10.d: "As the harsh rule of the Mamluks have been shrugged off the shoulders of the Syrian people, they welcomed Turkish armies to liberate them. The Syrians were well tolerated by the Ottoman Empire, as the lingual, and religious differences were trivial at best. A new beginning awaits."
 ME_TUR_Events.10.a: "I'm sure they'll appreciate our rule."

 ME_TUR_Events.13.t: "Capture of Rhodes"
 ME_TUR_Events.13.d: "The Knights of Rhodes had fended off our armies for much longer than anyone had ever expected. With only a meager garrison, they had managed to fend off multiple assaults on the fort, repelling even our elite Janissaries.\n\nAlas, their time has also come..."
 ME_TUR_Events.13.a: "They have fought valiantly and we will spare them."
 ME_TUR_Events.13.b: "No quarter!"
 
 ME_TUR_Events.14.t: "Capture of Cyprus"
 ME_TUR_Events.14.d: "While it was under foreign influence, the island of Cyprus was a bastion of Latin influence in the region.; now that Cyprus belongs to us, we can finally expel the Latin Kings and institute our own regime. Additionally, an interesting opportunity has arisen. The Orthodox Church of Cyprus, pleased they are no longer under Catholic rule, has offered to administrate the island in stead of our own governors and officials."
 ME_TUR_Events.14.a: "Have at it, then."
 ME_TUR_Events.14.b: "We had other plans..."
 
 ME_TUR_Events.15.t: "Bribing the Mamluks"

 ME_TUR_Events.15.a: "Ever closer!"
 
 ME_TUR_Events.16.t: "Capture of Tunis"
 ME_TUR_Events.16.d: "The capture of Tunis is a source of anxiety for the Christian kings of Europe. It signals an ever encroaching threat upon Western Europe and has subsequently sparked debate about once again attempting to quell the Ottoman threat. $EMPERORNAME$ has called for a coalition to fight the us and is willing to see it through."
 ME_TUR_Events.16.a: "We shall see about that one."
 ME_TUR_Events.16.b: "We can be diplomatic about this."

 ME_TUR_Events.17.t: "The Expedition Defeated!"
 ME_TUR_Events.17.d: "The Kings of Europe have failed in their poor excuse of a Crusade. The trade competition in Tunis is undoubtedly our sovereignty."

 ME_TUR_Events.18.t: "The Fall of Tunis"
 ME_TUR_Events.18.d: "Our attempts to repel the Emperor's expedition have failed. The Emperor has demanded we step down from our ambitions in North Africa and beyond, and sadly we must abide."
 ME_TUR_Events.18.a: "Dammit all!"
 
 ME_TUR_Events.19.t: "The Sultans of Morocco"
 ME_TUR_Events.19.d: "Since we had begun expanding our influence in North Africa many decades ago, we have kept a close eye on the sultans of Morocco. They're presence in the region has made them somewhat of a bulwark against the Christian aggressors in Iberia. They have not found great success in repelling them as stronghold after stronghold have been lost to the Portuguese and Spanish. Hundreds of miles of territory and unsure passage once stood between our lands and theirs, but there is now safe passage to join our realms. Should we offer them a hand, as brother's in faith, or exploit their weakness?"

 ME_TUR_Events.20.t: "The Occupation of Fez"
 ME_TUR_Events.20.d: "Since we had begun expanding our influence in North Africa many decades ago, we have kept a close eye on the sultans of Morocco.

 ME_TUR_Events.21.t: "Dissolution of Tlemcen"
 ME_TUR_Events.21.d: "The Kingdom of Tlemcen has seen better days; and the city of Tlemcen even more. Unfortunately, the sands of time weather all, and the city no longer holds the same importance it once was. All shan't go to waste, though. shall we resettle Tlemcen's inhabitants?"

 ME_TUR_Events.22.t: "Morocco, an Ottoman state?"
 ME_TUR_Events.22.d: "Now sandwiched between two great powers the rulers of Morocco have found themselves in a precarious position. The powers that be within Morocco have argued on whether to further align with the Ottoman Sultan, or if the current arrangement is adequate. A significant faction has proposed that they officially submit to the Sultan as subjects, so they may both remain autonomous and safe. Another rather zealous minority wish to allow the [TUR.Monarch.GetName], the proclaimed Caliph, to rule the nation."

 ME_TUR_Events.24.d: "The Cradle of Civilization has been a hotly contested region since the dawn of mankind, and we are yet another player in this great game; this time it is the Persians who contest our claim and hegemony over these ancient lands. It is no secret that our invasion of the Caucuses have brought anxiety to the rulers of Persia. Things have recently come to a head when a herald from [event_target:TUR_persian_power.GetName] has presented us with an unbelievable ultimatum: a demand to stop our expansion in the area, or intervention may follow. The gall! This great insult has aroused calls for preemptive action against the them, but others think that is exactly what they want..."

 ME_TUR_Events.25.t: "Janissary Rule in Tripolitania"
 ME_TUR_Events.25.d: "The rule over Tripoli was granted to a Pasha appointed by [Root.Monarch.GetName], who was assigned a janissary corps to command. This did not last long; the janissaries became the primary governing force in the region with the Pasha's role quickly diminishing in importance. Taking the reigns again should be no more than an inconvenience, but it seems the janissaries are doing a fine job."

 ME_TUR_Events.27.t: "The Principality of Upper Hungary"
 ME_TUR_Events.27.d: "The lands of Upper Hungary are the homelands of the Slovak people who have not known native rule in ages.

 ME_TUR_Events.29.t: "Expansion of the Janissary Corps"
 ME_TUR_Events.29.d: "The growth of the Ottoman Military is not without a similar growth in the ever-relevant Janissary Corps. The Sultan sees it fit to expand them in particular due to the constantly evolving foreign militaries and shift away from mercenary companies and feudal levies. We can't allow ourselves to rest on our laurels and be left behind!"
