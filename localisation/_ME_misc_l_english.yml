 elephants: "Elephants"
 elephantsDESC: "Since times immemorial, elephants have made up the brunt of infantry in some African and Indian nations. Despite their large and cumbersome stature, they can run far faster than a man, thus allowing for decent flanking ability and possibly offering a substitution for horsemen. Though their rarity makes them expensive, any elephants procured make for useful machinations of war."
