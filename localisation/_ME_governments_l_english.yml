Now we have our own state again, a country in which we can practice our religion without fear of persecution. Still, our time sheltering in the lands of others has lead us to be more accepting of others, but also more vicious in the defense of our own."
 zoroastrian_second_reform: "Zoroastrian Methodology"
 zoroastrian_second_reform_desc: "Accepting others is now a fundamental part of our culture and religion.
