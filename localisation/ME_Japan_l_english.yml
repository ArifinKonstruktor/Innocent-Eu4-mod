 jap_sankin_kotai_title: "Sankin-Kotai"
 jap_sankin_kotai_desc: "Rather than simply imprison the worst lords and risk rebellion, we can take a far more subtle approach to weakening and integrating them by obligating them to visit the capital regularly. Implementing a policy of 'alternate attendance' would compel the lords to maintain two residencies, one in their own domains and one in the capital, and of course they would be expected to travel back and forth in extravagant processions. The cost of all this would bankrupt all but the wealthiest lords, preventing them from accumulating the funds they would need to maintain a private army. It would also help bolster our own power in the capital, and make it a far more attractive place for courtiers and diplomats."

 jap_permit_ryogaesho_desc: "Many daimyos have suffered from erratic finances, causing some to default on loans they have taken.

 jap_rice_broker_title: "Rice Broker"
 jap_rice_broker_desc: "As urbanization and other economic shifts became significantly widespread and powerful in the 14th century, the growth of towns created a growth in demand for the transport of produce, particularly rice, into the towns, from increasingly larger and further rural areas. As a result, a system of material transport and warehousing in Kyoto emerged. This process was much the same as the one which would catapult Japan into the modern era in the Edo period, but on a smaller scale, more localized around the Kinai area, and centered at Kyoto instead of Osaka, which would become the commercial center of a nationwide trade system three hundred years later."

 jap_gokaido_title: "Gokaido"
 jap_gokaido_desc: "Although our domestic opponents have been subdued, it is important that we keep these lords in check. Building a new system of roads and waystations would help make the daimyos' domains easier to reach from the capital and boost local commerce along those routes in the process."

Although officially they are at the bottom of the social ladder, it's hard to look down on people so rich and so financially adept. Perhaps it is time we actively supported these merchants, and helped them develop these... what should we call these mercantile conglomerates? 'Zaibatsu'?"
