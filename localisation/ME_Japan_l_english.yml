 # Events:
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME1: "A New Favored Class?"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC1: "We are no strangers to favors and benefits. Despite the decent performance of our current system, we have the ability to promote a single class and coordinate with it throughout [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s reign ensuing not only their loyalty but also a variety of back-and-forth quid pro quos. Even though many advocate against such a policy, there is certainly some merit to at least consider it."
 ME_Japan_Events1.EVTOPT1: "Let us promote the Samurai."
 ME_Japan_Events1.EVTOPT2: "We should discuss business with the Merchants."
 ME_Japan_Events1.EVTOPT3: "Let us turn to the religious heads."
 ME_Japan_Events1.EVTOPT4: "No quid pro quo!"
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME3: "Period of Growth"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC3: "The dawn of a new age of stability saw [Root.GetName] prospering and expanding its population. Private schools, the issuing of new coinage and the growth of literacy and commerce all contributed to what later historians dubbed 'the developing sense of elegance and refinement of [Root.GetName]'. As such, it is now that we are called up to decide how we will guide our prestigious Empire to greater highs."
 ME_Japan_Events3.EVTOPT1: "Let us focus on conquest."
 ME_Japan_Events3.EVTOPT2: "The future rests in our maritime endeavours."
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME4: "The Meiji Restoration"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC4: "A period later dubbed 'Meiji Restoration' gripped Japan during the Age of Revolutions. Times of instability, warring factions and Daimyo at arms, split into two camps. Those loyal to the Emperor, favoring innovativeness and western influences versus those in favor of the Shogun, and his manifesto of traditional values and seclusion. A fascinating crossroads of history in our time."
 ME_Japan_Events4.EVTOPT1: "These are dark times."

 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME5: "The End of the Meiji Restoration"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC5: "Years of instability have taken a heavy toll on our lands. Crops fed with the blood of our brothers whilst our cattle die of hunger. Families broken and communities lay shattered while houses and entire neighborhoods are nothing but a smoldering ashe and a pile of memories. What horrors or joys the future may hold, none dare imagine. A blood moon looms over Japan and the atrocities have ceased. Let us put these dark times behind us , as we delve into the unknown depths of the future with our heads held up high."
 ME_Japan_Events5.EVTOPT1: "The worst is behind you, brother."
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME6: "Daimyo Lords Demand Autonomy"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC6: "As the rebellion rages on and the Emperor clashes with the Shogun in the open, the puny Daimyo Lords under our rule found our weakest time to demand more influence and autonomy. Such cutthroat diplomacy is evidence of their collaboration withe the enemy but nevertheless we need them on our side."
 ME_Japan_Events6.EVTOPT1: "A few concessions for the greater good."
 ME_Japan_Events6.EVTOPT2: "They answer to me!"
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME7: "Open Rebellion of [GetYear]"

 ME_Japan_Events7.EVTOPT2: "They will learn to fear me!"
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME8: "Shiroyama"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC8: "As the Meiji Restoration crisis rages on, a band of noble elite samurai makes a last stand against the forces of modernization. Their Lord, a remnant of the past and the continuation of centuries of tradition, or a detached relic and a fool. Whatever our opinion of him and his men is, they certainly made a name for themselves simply by exhibiting the utmost bravery and honor in the face of death and dispair. This is a showdown for the ages, the sword faces the gun."
 ME_Japan_Events8.EVTOPT1: "Let us side with the samurai!"
 ME_Japan_Events8.EVTOPT2: "Surround and outnumber them!"
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME9: "Speech of Victory"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC9: "... I do need the Westerners. And their backing. Would you like to know why? 'I have a dream. That one day, every person in this nation will control their own destiny. A landof the truly free. A nation of ACTION, not words. Ruled by STRENGTH, not committee or foreigners. Where the law changes to suit the individual, not the other way around. Where power and justice are back where they belong: in the hands of the people! Where every man is free to think - to act - for himself! To hell with all the bureaucrats and outsiders who poison our minds. To hell with this daily spew of trivialities. To hell with tradition and modernization. To hell with the Europeans! All of them! Japan is diseased. Rotten to the core. There's no saving it - we need to pull it out by the roots. WIpe the slate clean. Burn it down! And from the ashes, a new Japan will be born. Evolved, but untamed! The weak will be purged, and the strongest will thrive - free to live as they see fit, they will make Japan GREAT AGAIN! Please understand. I'm using war as a business to get the throne... so I can end war as a business! In my new Japan, people will die and kill for what they believe! Not for money, not for coal! Not for what they're told is right. Every man will be free to fight his own wars!'"
 ME_Japan_Events9.EVTOPT1: "... thus spoke [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 ME_Japan_Events9.EVTOPT2: "... signed, Emperor Meiji, [GetYear]."
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME10: "The Khan's Rebellion"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC10: "Years of rebellion and harsh treatment have accumulated to the resentment of our subjects in Manchuria. Despite our best efforts to quell their separatist sentiment, our temporary weakness seems to have emboldened them to demand more rights and autonomy! They should be punished as misbehaving children and be reminded of who they serve!"
 ME_Japan_Events10.EVTOPT1: "We will grant them autonomy!"
 ME_Japan_Events10.EVTOPT2: "Let them defect, for all we care!"
 ME_Japan_Events10.EVTOPT3: "We had no use of them anyway."
 ME_Japan_Events10.EVTOPT4: "They shall taste the boot."
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME11: "The Joseon Rebellion"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC11: "Years of rebellion and harsh treatment have accumulated to the resentment of our subjects in Korea.

 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME12: "Successors of Krung Tai"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC12: "Once a powerful Kingdom, adorned with gold and gems as far as the eye can see, now lies in ruins. In its stead, the [Root.GetAdjective] Empire, our proudest military advisors have devised a plan to overtake the entire region as peacefully as possible. A member of the last Prasat Thong dynasty wishes to press his claim onto the entire region in exchange of the Chrysanthemum Throne. Whilst this move would definitely upset our people, it would essentially legitimize further conquest in the old region."
 ME_Japan_Events12.EVTOPT1: "The throne is his."
 ME_Japan_Events12.EVTOPT2: "Let us just celebrate our conquest!"
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME13: "Declawing the Tiger"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC13: "To administer the beautifully intellectual courts of Japan and Edo is easy, as our administrators point out. Whatever deceit happens is usually elegant and purposeful. The same cannot be said of our subjects in Manchuria. These ill-mannered brutes who know not of etiquette and administration have proved to be quite a handful for our local governors. The local officials have time and again asked for the Imperial Guard to intervene and crush riots whilst these horse-loving savages dare to demand independence. How will [Root.Monarch.GetName] handle this?"
 ME_Japan_Events13.EVTOPT1: "Send a message."
 ME_Japan_Events13.EVTOPT2: "We shall grant some autonomy."
 ME_Japan_Events13.EVTOPT3: "Some radical reforms are in order."
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME14: "Campaign into South China"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC14: "Months of planning, years of relentless training and days spent adjusting our organization strategies have culminated in this moment. The final decision of the execution of such a grand campaign rests on the shoulders of [Root.Monarch.Name]. We may approach the Chinese continent by sea, blockade their ports and invade their coasts on multiple points. We can however also raze through their land with incredible speed and ferocity, stunning them as we march through their countryside. Let our plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when we move, fall like a thunderbolt."
 ME_Japan_Events14.EVTOPT1: "We shall invade by the sea!"
 ME_Japan_Events14.EVTOPT2: "We shall march to their capital!"
 
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTNAME15: "Fate of the Emperorship"
 ME_Japan_Events.EVTDESC15: "As the last bastion of [emperor_of_china.GetName] falls to anarchy and violence, the people look upon our enlightened Emperor [Root.Monarch.GetName] for guidance. What shall be the fate of the Crown?"
 ME_Japan_Events15.EVTOPT1: "One Crown to Rule them All and in the Light Guide Them."
 ME_Japan_Events15.EVTOPT2: "Their crown belongs with their last Emperor, dead and forgotten."
