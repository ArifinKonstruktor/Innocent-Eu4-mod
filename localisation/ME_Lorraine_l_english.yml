 lor_secure_champagne_title: "Secure Champagne"

 lor_develop_the_ore_industry_title: "Fund the Ore Industry"
 lor_develop_the_ore_industry_desc: "The hills of Alsace contain numerous mineral deposits, and the iron we exctract is becoming coveted by countries across Europe. With the growing importance of artillery, it becomes more and more vital for any leader to be able to secure a source of iron to fuel their conquests.

 lor_challenge_the_duke_of_luxembourg_title: "Challenge Luxembourg"

 lor_shield_of_kin_title: "Shield of Kin"
 lor_shield_of_kin_desc: "The king of France has always been our greatest protector. Even if our relations have not always been friendly, we still need a great power to defend our small duchy. While some in our court will not be fond of such a proposition of dependancy and alliance, such a scenario is surely preferable to facing the world alone, lest we are able to stand firm and strong against the currents of our future enemies."
 lor_lock_down_the_west_title: "Lock Down the West"
 lor_lock_down_the_west_desc: "The lands of Western Burgundy are rich and populous. At the crossroads of the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire, the region has prospered and the wealth it contains is coveted by the French King and the Emperor. However, both seem to forget that these lands are legitimate territories of the crown of Lothair, and thus shall be returned to us. By occupying the western region, we will be sure that the French will be kept out of our affairs in Burgundy."
 lor_eradicate_burgundy_title: "Eradicate Burgundy" 
 lor_lock_down_the_west_desc: "The lands of Western Burgundy are rich and populous. At the crossroads of the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire, the region has prospered and the wealth it contains is coveted by the French King and the Emperor. However, both seem to forget that these lands are legitimate territories of the crown of Lothair, and thus shall be returned to us. By occupying the western region, we will be sure that the French will be kept out of our affairs in Burgundy. They will certainly not be pleased by that, but the people there knows that we are mandated by God to rule them and will certainly join our ranks in flock now that we have liberated them."
 lor_eradicate_burgundy_title: "Eradicate Burgundy"
 lor_eradicate_burgundy_desc: "For too long has the dukes of Burgundy tried to integrate us into their state, to connect their lands in France and the Low Countries. We already managed to repel them and even occupy some of their lands. Now that their duchy is weak, it is time to strike. A quick assault through the plains and the occupation of some key cities may be enough for us to force the duke to submit to us. Later, these lands shall be completely integrated and we will make another step towards the complete restoration of the power of the crown of Lothair."
 lor_support_the_textile_industry_title: "Support the Textile Industry"
 lor_support_the_textile_industry_desc: "After our recent conquests, we managed to get our hand on the most important textile industries in Europe. The cloth produced in our Notherwestern provinces is known in the entire continent for its quality.

We shall repair the infrastructures and encourage the people to restart their activities to restart the economy in the region and eventually profit from it."

 lor_secure_independence_desc: "Our once mighty Kingdom, who stretched from the Low Countries to the Mediterranean, is now reduced to a small strip of land stuck between more powerful kingdoms, subject to a King who claims to be more than he his in reality.

 lor_unite_lorraine_title: "Unite Lorraine"
 lor_unite_lorraine_desc: "While we are surrounded by powerful neighbors, a small strip of land known as the Moving Barrois could be integrated to our duchy.

 lor_the_struggle_for_power_title: "The Struggle for Power"
 lor_the_struggle_for_power_desc: "While being stuck between France and the Empire is a drawback, we won't just sit there will waiting for one of them to just move on us.

 lor_contest_lothairs_crown_title: "Contest the Crown"

Our army is ready and determined to fight for our duke."
 lor_secure_the_east_title: "Secure the East"

Eventually, she was captured by the Duke of Burgundy and later sold to the English, who burned her at the stake, officially for being an heretic but in reality for revenge. We know that Jeanne d'Arc was no heretic. Born in our lands, it our our duty to honorate her memory and never forget her heroic actions."

With our conquest of the region, we got our hands on the best artillery manufactures in Europe. By combining this superior equipment with our new tactics developped after our multiple wars, we should be able to develop a modern strategy that will allow us to siege any fortification in the continent."

 lor_lorraine_resurgent_title: "Lorraine Resurgent"
 lor_lorraine_resurgent_desc: "We did it. After centuries of decline, from our positions as mere subjects of foreign kings, we managed to grow in size and power, and finally, after countless wars and conflicts, we managed to reclaim what's rightfully our : The Crown of Lothair is finally reunited.

 #Events
 ME_Lorraine_Events.1.t: "Growth of Industry in Metz"
 ME_Lorraine_Events.1.d: "Our renovation and our improvements of the city of Metz have paid off, and the city has now a booming economy. Merchants from the East and the West come to trade, and we directly profit from the wealth generated. Another consequence from this is the growing urbanization. A certain number of small manufactories were built on the outskirt of the cities, producing precious goods, mostly textile and glass. We could encourage the production of either these goods to enrich the city."
 ME_Lorraine_Events.1.a: "The finest cloth for our people."
 ME_Lorraine_Events.1.b: "Glass is the future!"

The Lower duchy was quickly dismantled, while Upper Lorraine came to be known as simply the Duchy of Lorraine. We are the direct and most legitimate successor of the crown of Lothair. While we are not necessarily in the best position currently, with our independence finally recovered, we should still be able to claim our rightful lands."
 ME_Lorraine_Events.3.a: "We shall reclaim the crown of Lothair!"

 LOR_RESTORE_LOTHARINGIA_CLAIMS_CT: "We will lay claim on the lands of our former Kingdom."
