 POL_mission_to_pope_desc: "The Papal Curia, ever so much interested in the concerns of the catholic church around the European Continent, has had several bishops established as their legates in the Polish Lands.

 POL_embrace_renaissance_title: "Wloska Mysl"
 POL_embrace_renaissance_desc: "The Renaissance 'Odrodzenie', made its way into Poland in the early 16th century. One of the events that helped the new school of thought arrive in Poland was the marriage between the King Sigismund the First and the daughter of the Milanese duke, Bona Sforza.

 POL_sejm_mission_title: "Fate of Poland"
 POL_sejm_mission_desc: "With the unexpected death of the King, Władysław the III, at Varna, the polish state and government was left in shock and discord.

 POL_ruthenia_title: "Settle the East"
 POL_ruthenia_desc: "The lands of the Red Ruthenia have been conquered under the rule of Kazimierz the Great, and have be been held ever since.

 POL_expand_krakow_title: "Expand Krakow"
 POL_expand_krakow_desc: "Kraków, being the capital of the Polish Crown, and the seat of the Jagiellonian University, is definitely the most important city in the country.

 POL_support_cities_title: "Support Cities"
 POL_support_cities_desc: "The polish cities were never greatly favored by the government.

 POL_zwiazek_pruski_title: "Prussian Confederation"
 POL_zwiazek_pruski_desc: "The Prussian Confederation (Zwiazek Pruski) was an alliance of wealth Prussian Cities aimed against the neglectful Grandmaster of the Teutonic Order.

 POL_expand_gdansk_title: "Expanding Gdansk"
 POL_expand_gdansk_desc: "Ever since the establishment of the Lubeck port in the Baltic Sea, as well as the growth of the Baltic Sea trade that ensued, the Trading Port of Danzig was invaluable to the means of exchange and were central to the economy of the state that controlled it. Unfortunately, the port was lost for a rather lengthy period to the Teutonic Knights, who were recently forced to abandon the control over the city. As a result, the vast quantities of Grain that follow the flow of Vistula river are finally sold to the foreign merchants that visit Gdańsk for the purpose of means of exchange."
 POL_moldavia_title: "Hospodarstwo Mołdawskie"
 POL_moldavia_desc: "The voivodes of the Moldavian Principality are doing their best to please all of their neighbors, the encroaching Ottomans in the south, their Hungarian threat in the west, and the Polish Jagiellons to the north.

 POL_revenge_for_varna_desc: "On the 10th of November, 1444, Wladyslaw, King of Poland and Hungary died in the Battle of Varna effectively ending the crusade against the Ottomans. The rising muslim state used that as an opportunity to accelerate its rapid growth and to establish firm control in Balkans, and to bring the surrounding territories into its fold. This prospect of Muslim-threatened christianity is not only terrific, but also quite possible with the things are going right now. We must organize another crusade and avenge the loss at Varna once and for all."
 POL_rada_krolewska_title: "Rada Królewska"
 POL_rada_krolewska_desc: "The King's Council (Rada Królewska) wasn't quite a formal institution. Initially it was more of a position held by King's trusted members, it was only given more privileges and importance in 1422, where the King had to acquire an agreement from the council to mint new coin. At the end of the XV century, it became a part of the Senate."
 POL_estates_of_poland_title: "Estates of Poland"
 POL_estates_of_poland_desc: "In the changing landscape of the European Politics of the 15th century, estates were gaining more and more influence in the politics of the ruler, as opposed to the state.

 POL_bohemian_diplomacy_title: "Entropy to the West"
 POL_bohemian_diplomacy_desc: "The Bohemian State has been in near-constant disarray following the failure at Varna in 1444. We need to assert our state's dominance over the Czech kingdom, either by finally seizing control over the silesian principalities, or by simply outgrowing them. We shall exploit this entropy and fill the chaotic void!"
 POL_bohemian_PU_title: "Besting Boleslaw"
 POL_bohemian_PU_desc: "Boleslaw the Brave was one of the most powerful rulers Poland has had to date. Having established himself a King, as opposed to a duke, he greatly increased the influence of Poland in the European Theater. He also conducted many conquests, one of them being subjugation of the Czech territories. His control was short-lived though, much unlike our conquest, which shall best the achievements of Boleslaw himself!"
 POL_hungarian_diplomacy_title: "The Discord in Hungary"
 POL_hungarian_diplomacy_desc: "The death of king Wladyslaw at Varna has not only shaken the nobles of Poland, but also the nobility of our southern neighbors, Hungary. Despite the certain shock, the nobles took matters into their own hands quite quickly, having elected a new ruler, a year after the death of te famed Varna crusader. Unfortunately, the elected ruler wasn't the right choice, as the [Root.Monarch.GetDynasty] doesn't seem to be ruling Hungary..."
 POL_hungarian_PU_title: "Spuscizna Andegawenska"
 POL_hungarian_PU_desc: "In history lies the beauty of the Jagiellon heritage. The dynasty was founded on the love of the Lithuanian lineage and the Angevin virtue in the unity of conjoined marriage.
