 ME_Swabian_Events.1.d: "As the rightful Dukes of Swabia, we are ruling the land where the famous Hohenstaufen dynasty originates from. This is the birthplace of Frederick Barbarossa, one of, if not the greatest Holy Roman Emperor of all time. This late medieval dynasty is named after a castle of Hohenstaufen which is in the hands of the Wurttemberg counts all of whom are our de facto vassals. Sadly, from what is known to us, the current family ruling the state has no direct connections to the dynasty and it is common knowledge that holding claim to such a lineage would be beneficial to the dynasty."

 ME_Swabian_Events.10.a: "Marvelous."
 
 ME_Swabian_Events.11.t: "Italy Under our Rule"
