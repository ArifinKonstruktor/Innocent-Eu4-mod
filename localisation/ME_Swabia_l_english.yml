 #formable events
 
 ME_Swabian_Events.1.t: "The Hohenstaufen Legacy"
 ME_Swabian_Events.1.d: "As the rightful Dukes of Swabia, we are ruling the land where the famous Hohenstaufen dynasty originates from. This is the birthplace of Frederick Barbarossa, one of, if not the greatest Holy Roman Emperor of all time. This late medieval dynasty is named after a castle of Hohenstaufen which is in the hands of the Wurttemberg counts all of whom are our de facto vassals. Sadly, from what is known to us, the current family ruling the state has no direct connections to the dynasty and it is common knowledge that holding claim to such a lineage would be beneficial to the dynasty."
 ME_Swabian_Events.1.a: "Forgery of some documents should get the job done."
 ME_Swabian_Events.1.b: "Trifle."
 ME_Swabian_Events.2.t: "Site for Counterreformation Center"

 ME_Swabian_Events.3.t: "A Letter from the Emperor"
 ME_Swabian_Events.3.d: "The Holy Roman Emperor is offering us protection, if we care to join his so called 'Empire'. Every man with a slight knowledge of the current political situation of Europe understands that this is a request of submission - by joining the empire, we are swearing fealty to the emperor. What shall we do?"
 ME_Swabian_Events.3.a: "We accept."
 ME_Swabian_Events.3.b: "We shall swear no fealty to a false pretender!"
 ME_Swabian_Events.8.t: "Rein in Northern Italy"
 ME_Swabian_Events.8.d: "After many years of disconnection, Northern Italy is back again in the firm grip of the Emperor's hands. To achieve this, a lot of diplomacy had to be conducted and many men had to die to integrate all of the Northern Italians back into the Empire."
 ME_Swabian_Events.8.a: "A large step on the way of uniting Europe!"
 ME_Swabian_Events.9.t: "The Lost Sheep found"
 ME_Swabian_Events.9.d: "The Herd of small tiny states have disconnected from the empire and sought to 'preserve' their state. Thanks to successful diplomacy and impressive military, we were able to bring the lost herd back to the pen."
 ME_Swabian_Events.9.a: "The Emperor Protects."
 ME_Swabian_Events.10.t: "The West Francia"
 ME_Swabian_Events.10.d: "West Frankish domain is finally in the rightful successor to the Charlemagne's Empire. The Empire has never been so unified before, and this is certainly a proud achievement to be proud of."
 ME_Swabian_Events.10.a: "Marvelous."
 ME_Swabian_Events.11.t: "Italy Under our Rule"
 ME_Swabian_Events.11.d: "Italy, although never fully under Frankish control, must be part of the new Empire spanning over the European continent. With Italy brought on it's knees, we are ready to centralize the new territories and declare the Holy Roman Empire."
 ME_Swabian_Events.11.a: "Italy will make a fine addition to my collection."
