 ME_Swabian_Events.1.d: "As the rightful Dukes of Swabia, we are ruling the land where the famous Hohenstaufen dynasty originates from. This is the birthplace of Frederick Barbarossa, one of, if not the greatest Holy Roman Emperor of all time. This late medieval dynasty is named after a castle of Hohenstaufen which is in the hands of the Wurttemberg counts all of whom are our de facto vassals. Sadly, from what is known to us, the current family ruling the state has no direct connections to the dynasty and it is common knowledge that holding claim to such a lineage would be beneficial to the dynasty."

What shall we do?"

 ME_Swabian_Events.7.b: "Send them a highly cultured letter back."
 
 ME_Swabian_Events.8.t: "Rein in Northern Italy"
 ME_Swabian_Events.8.d: "After many years of disconnection, Northern Italy is back again in the firm grip of the Emperor's hands. To achieve this, a lot of diplomacy had to be conducted and many men had to die to integrate all of the Northern Italians back into the Empire."
 ME_Swabian_Events.8.a: "A large step on the way of uniting Europe!"
 
 ME_Swabian_Events.9.t: "The Lost Sheep found"
 ME_Swabian_Events.9.d: "The Herd of small tiny states have disconnected from the empire and sought to 'preserve' their state. Thanks to successful diplomacy and impressive military, we were able to bring the lost herd back to the pen."
