One of the most infamous moments of Nobunaga's reign was his incineration of the buddhist monastary of Mount Hiei, and all the monks inside, after they had aided an alliance of Daimyo against him.

 string_start_title_oda: "The Oda Clan, 1444"
 string_start_oda: "In 1444, Sengoku Jidai looms. In 2 short decades, the entirity of Japan descend into an age of bloodshed in which more people will die, then will live in France over the same time period.\n\nFrom Kyoto, the Emperor Go-Hanazono rules Japan, as the latest in a line of Emperor's going back 2000 years. However, in truth, much of the governing of the realm is left to the Shogun, who is supposed to be the Emperor's deputy in military matters. But in [GetYear] the Shogunate is not what it once was. A number of Ashikaga Shoguns have passed in quick succession over the last few years, due to both accidents and assassinations. On multiple occasons raiders have proven Kyoto is not safe, even for those tasked with keeping the peace across the entire realm.\nEver since the death of the last strong Ashikaga Shogun, Yoshimitsu, the more powerful clans of the realm have come to rival he Shogunate for power. The leading lords of such clans are known as Daimyo and have almost total power over their respective realms. Some, like the §YHosokawa§!, §YHatakeyama§! and §YShiba§! are closely tied to the shogunate and have monopolized the office of Kanrei, formal deputy of the Shogun. Others, like the §YYamana§!, §YAkamatsu§!, §YIsshiki§! and §YKyogoku§! assert influence simply through their own wealth and influence.\n\nIn 1444 The Daimyo of Owari is of the Oda clan. Nominally vassals of the Oda clan, the death of Shiba Yoshitake lead to the Shiba Vassals, Oda and Asakura, rising in support of a minor Shiba lord, and began dividing the Shiba lands between themselves, gradually becoming independant of Shiba rule.\n\nWhile the Oda influence in 1444 barely expands beyond the borders of Owari Province, they will one day become one of the most powerful clans in all of Japan.\nWhile many Daimyo desired Unification and a return to the comparative political stability of the earlier Moromachi period, Oda Nobunaga was the first for whom the goal seemed truly attainable. Under his leadership, the Oda, and those that allied with them, went on to unite almost the entirity of Honshu, the largest of the four islands that compose Japan. This was likely due to the fact that Nobunaga changed the way war was fought in Japan. His matchlock armed foot soldiers displaced Mounted soldiers armed with bows and swords. He built iron plated warships and imported saltpeter and lead for the manufature of gunpowder of bullets, while also manufaturing artillery. His ashigaru foot soldiers were trained and disciplined for mass moverments, and replaced hand to hand fighting tactics. They were provided distinctive uniforms to improve esprit de corps. Above all Nobunaga was ruthless in battle, pursuing fugitives without compassion. Through wanton slaughter, he became ruler of 20 provinces. In the land he dominated, he implemented a plan of economic development, including a decleration of free markets, the breaking of trade monopolies and providing for open guilds. Nobunaga initiated policies for civil administration, which included currency regulations, and the construction of roads and bridges. He set standards for road widths and planting trees along roadsides. All this was to ease the transport of soldiers and war material, in addition to commerce.\n\nGood Lord, If you truly wish to bring the Oda to even greater heights than Nobunaga did, then you have your work cut out for you.\n\nShoot for the stars, and go beyond.\nPlus Ultra!"
