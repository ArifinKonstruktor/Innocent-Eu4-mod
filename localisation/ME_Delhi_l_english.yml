 dlh_ideas: "Delhian Ideas"
 dlh_wazirs: "Wazirs and Diwans"
 dlh_wazirs_desc: "Delhi is unique, in that its monarchy is highly centralised and bureaucratic. There were many departments and officials who helped the Sultan in administration. The Naib was the most influential post and virtually enjoyed all the powers of the Sultan. He had control over all the other departments. The post of Wazir was next to the Naib and he headed the finance department known as the Diwan-i-Wizarat. An Auditor-General for examining expenditure and an Accountant General for checking income worked under the Wazir. The department of religious affairs, Diwan-i-Risalat dealt with pious foundations and granted stipends to deserving scholars and men of piety. This department granted funds for the construction of madrasas, tombs and mosques. It was headed by Chief Sadr who also functioned as Chief Qazi, the head of the judicial system. Other judges and Qazis were appointed in different parts of the Sultanate. This administrative system differed Delhi from traditional, provincial kingdoms, resulting in a highly centralised form of government, subservient to the Sultan"
 dlh_decimal_army: "Decimal Organisation"
 dlh_decimal_army_desc: "The organisation of the army and the division of ranks rested primarily on decimal system. In the cavalry, ten horse-men constituted a unit whose officer was called Sar-i-Khail. There was a Sipahsalar commanding units of ten Sar-i-Khails, an Amir over units of ten Sipahsalars , a Malik over units of ten Amirs and a Khan over units of ten Maliks. The decimal system allowed for ranks to be rigid and well organised."
 dlh_kharaj: "Collecting Kharaj's"
 dlh_kharaj_desc: "The main source of income of the state was land revenue. This denoted all taxes including Jizya raised from the non-Muslims. Alauddin Khalji raised the land tax from one-sixth to one-half of the gross produce. This included produce from peasant farms, which promoted innovation in agricultural methods in order to keep more of their own produce, such as irrigation and the use of the water wheel. Alauddin also promoted the use of gold and coin instead of raw goods as payment, to encourage increasing commercialisation, and stimulate local economies. "
 dlh_workshops: "Developing Private Kharkanas"
 dlh_workshops_desc: "There were, during the Delhi Sultanate period, two types of industries: those that were under the State patronage and those that were completely private. The Sultans had their own Karkhanas in Delhi in which many thousands of weavers were employed to produce silk and other stuffs; in these Karkhanas thousands of yards of silk and cotton cloth were produced every year for the preparation of robes of honour. The other kind of workshops, were for gold and silver articles and embroidery, and so on. As far as the private industries was concerned, the most important among them were the textile industry, that included in itself manufacturing of cloth, woollen and silk cloth, sugar industry, paper industry and more. The textile industry has brought great riches, and exemplify the wealth that India shows. It is important that these Kharkanas are patronised and expanded, lest we lose our most luxurious exports."
 dlh_mandis: "Paying the Army with Mandis"
 dlh_mandis_desc: "New tax policies and spending controls have begun strengthening our treasury to pay the keep of the growing army; introducing heavier price controls on all agriculture produce and goods in the kingdom, as well as controls on where, how, and by whom these goods could be sold. Markets called Shahana-i-Mandi were created where Muslim merchants were granted exclusive permits and monopoly in these "Mandis" to buy and resell at official prices. No one other than these merchants could buy from farmers or sell in cities. Taxes collected in the form of grain were stored in the kingdom's storage. During famines that followed, these granaries ensured sufficient food for the army. These Mandis help us feed and replenish our armies"
 dlh_defence: "A Two Pronged Defence"
 dlh_defence_desc: "Balban's military reforms and expertise was one of the greatest reasons that India was spared from the Mongol yoke. Embassies were exchanged and established between the Sultanate and the Hordes, in order to establish fast communication in case of victory, as well as vast defensive lines across areas like Lahore and Sunam. These lines helped defend vital chokepoints by the Hindu Kush mountains, and large metropolises such as the capital itself. Our recent defeats have been noted as examples on why we must return back to a defensive approach, before and ambitious Timurid, Mongol or Afghan to take control of any local chaos."
 dlh_infantry: "Away with Military Tribalism"
 dlh_infantry_desc: "Despite the reforms and progress made with both previous and present Sultans, there is still a lack of meritocracy and professionalism in the army. A strong and efficient organisation of the military means nothing when positions are generally hereditary and based off of autocratic patronage. Balban's idea of individual excellence presented a strong foundation of how we can approach the problem. By forcing soldiers to be the best they can possibly be, while utilising rigorous training methods, we can finally transition to Khasah Khail infantry corps."

 ### MISSIONS ###
 
 dlh_promote_mil_advisor_title: "Promote a Diwan-i-Ariz"
 dlh_promote_mil_advisor_desc: "Delhi's collapse has caused a great deal of chaos in our administration, with both our army and government left vacant and unorganised. Balban may have strengthened the central core of the military, but this is nothing without someone to fill the position."
 dlh_disenfranchise_slaves_title: "Disenfranchise the Slaves"
 dlh_disenfranchise_slaves_desc: "Balban began a tradition of favouring nobles and Indians over the influential Turkic slave soldiers, as their power threatened the Sultans tenable position. It is important that the power of these slaves are limited, to prevent any threat of coup, like in Bengal, or a return to the previous Mamluk Sultanate."
 dlh_balban_reforms_title: "Continuing the Reforms"
 dlh_balban_reforms_desc: "The beginning of the Alai era, after the collapse of the Mamluk Sultanate, saw Delhi's army move away from traditional slave soldiery and Turkic warriors, to Khasah-khail, or Special Infantry. Balban also ordered the separation of the military department from the Diwan-i–Wizarai, and placed the military department under a the Diwan-i-Ariz. These reforms helped strengthen Delhi's military, promoting individual excellence rather than standardised training, ensuring that each soldier trained competitively and to their limit."
 dlh_issue_land_title: "Issuing Land Grants"
 dlh_issue_land_desc: "Land is distributed through 3 methods. Iqta land is given as a subsidiary instead of outright payment for officials, as thanks for their services. Khalisa land is the Sultan's own, and the revenue generated is used to fund the royal household. Finally, Inam land is for religious officials to appease the clergy. In order to prevent disaster once again, we must find a balance between patronage and preventing puppet status."
 dlh_textile_innovations_title: "Textile Innovations"
 dlh_textile_innovations_desc: "Thousands of weavers are employed in Kharkanas, where yards upon yards of robes, silks and cottons would be weaved and produced. In order to prevent any shortages in the future, we must ensure, as early adopters of the water wheel and the worm gear roller, that our monopoly on textiles does not falter"
 dlh_heavy_regulations_title: "Regulating Trade"
 dlh_heavy_regulations_desc: "While the reforms of Alauddin Khalji have been heavily criticised, being seen as burdensome and controlling, they have prevented price fluctuations and severe grain shortages in times of turmoil and disaster. However, it wouldn't hurt to open up some of these restrictions, as it has become clear that trade is becoming the dominant source of income. We must still keep a close eye, before our riches spiral into the hands of others."
 dlh_artillery_title: "Proliferating Falconets"
 dlh_artillery_desc: "The change in modern warfare has placed focus on Gunpowder and guns. We must acquire these weapons if we are to stand the test of time, and to further our conquests. While our military will never truly embrace these new weapons, we can ornament our military with small siege weapons to enhance our siege potential."
 dlh_tamil_spices_title: "Tamil Trade Guilds"
 dlh_tamil_spices_desc: "The newly acquired territories along the Coromandel Coast is home to an autonomous community of traders, the Tamil Kings. These merchants hold great control over the spice trade, with exports from Malaya and Southern India into Arabia and beyond. Their autonomy is annoying, yet any collapse of the network they have established could potentially cause chaos in the trading world. It is important that their independence is mildly recognised, provided that they pledge allegiance to the Sultan, and adhere to some social policies."
 dlh_elephant_warfare_title: "Elephant Warfare"
 dlh_elephant_warfare_desc: "The forces were commanded by the Sultans as they were the chief lawgiver and the final of the court of appeal. Amirs, Khans, and Maliks were the titles of the military gradation. Men from different nations were enlisted in the army. The army was divided into infantry, cavalry, and elephant corps, with elephants being seen as worth 500 horsemen. They are large and hardy, and have helped us conquer swaths of India. We must continue the long-standing tradition of Elephant warfare."
 dlh_qazis_title: "A New Qazi-ul-Qazat"
 dlh_qazis_desc: "The Qazi-ul-Qazat was the chief of the Justice Department. He was assisted in this task by several Qazis and Kotwals who helped him in keeping law and order in the country and in the administration of justice. There is an issue with this, as several Ulema happen to also be Qazis, in which they have shown disdain for our Hindu subjects, and often misinterpret Quranic law to further their own needs. The only power is the sultan, so it would be wise to appoint someone who works for the state, not the church."
 dlh_city_of_taj_title: "The City of the Taj"
 dlh_city_of_taj_desc: "A city lies on the banks of the Yamuna, dating back to the legends of Krishna and Mahabharata. While not nearly as grand as Delhi once was, it is in a prime position in the centre of the Doab to grow, with local bazars and entrepots already established. With some effort, the city could become a principle administrative centre, and the heart of Delhi's resurgence"
 dlh_claiming_india_title: "Lay Claim on India"
 dlh_claiming_india_desc: "Much of Northern India is still in tumultuous ruin, with various states destroying each other over and over again. In order to achieve our dreams of a unified India, we must have the army for it. We once fielded an army three Lakh big, waged wars with the Mongols, defied any Chinese attempts to breach the Himalayas. Nothing should stop us."
 dlh_diamond_delhi_title: "A Diamond in the Rough"
 dlh_diamond_delhi_desc: "Delhi's history has been tumultuous and destructive. Massive population loss and general ruin has brought the city to the brink of death numerous times. However, the oldest city in India has stayed strong, and the city is once again flourishing under renewed leadership. Surrounded by warfare, It has remained bejewelled and dazzling; a diamond in the rough"
 dlh_bengali_jamdani_title: "Bengali Jamdani"
 dlh_bengali_jamdani_desc: "While it is upsetting that Bengal has flourished without our administration, The previous Sultans have indeed left us a territory with great potential. The city of Dhaka is one example, with thousands of weavers producing the most beautiful works of fabric ever seen by the Sultan."

 ### EVENTS ###

 ME_Delhi_Events.1.t: "Monumental Gardens"
 ME_Delhi_Events.1.d: "Believed to be one of the oldest full dome building in Delhi, the Bada Gumbad is one of 4 monuments that are in the Lodi gardens. The Bada Gumbad was constructed to provide a gateway to the nearby mosque or a large walled enclosure. Although the structure does not house any tomb, there is a platform in the central courtyard that suggests the structure to be a burial place. Three out of five bays in the mosque have domes whereas the remaining two have vaulted roofs\n\nThe dome, the mosque and the mehman khana are constructed of red, grey and black stone, including grey quartzite and red sandstone. The interior is elaborately ornamented with painted stucco. Coloured tiles, incised carvings, and painted plaster on the mosque are decorated with foliage, flowers, geometric patterns, and Quranic inscriptions."
 ME_Delhi_Events.1.opt1: "These gardens will be immortalised"

 ME_Delhi_Events.2.t: "Aram Bagh"
 ME_Delhi_Events.2.d: "'It always appears to me, that one of the chief defects of Hindustan is the want of artificial watercourses. I had intended, wherever I might fix my residence, to construct water-wheels, to produce an artificial stream, and to lay out an elegant and regularly planned pleasure ground. Shortly after coming to Agra I passed the Jumna with this object in view, and examined the country to pitch upon a fit spot for a garden. The whole was so ugly and detestable that I repassed the river quite repulsed and disgusted. In consequence of the want of beauty and of the disagreeable aspect of the country, I gave up my intention of making a charbagh; but as no better situation presented itself near Agra, I was finally compelled to make the best of this same spot.... In every corner I planted suitable gardens, in every garden I sowed roses and narcissus regularly, and in beds corresponding to each other. We were annoyed by three things in Hindustan; one was its heat, another the strong winds, and the third its dust. Baths were the means of removing all three inconveniences.'"
 ME_Delhi_Events.2.opt1: "Gardens are a beautiful way of memorialising the past"

 ME_Delhi_Events.3.t: "Renovating the Qutb Minar Complex"
 ME_Delhi_Events.3.d: "The Qutb Complex are a group of monuments and buildings built during the 13th and 14th century in Delhi. Construction of the Qutb Minar in the complex, named after the religious figure Sufi Saint Khwaja Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki, was begun by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, who later became the first  Sultan of Delhi of the Mamluk dynasty. It was continued by his successor Iltumish, and finally completed much later by Firoz Shah Tughlaq in 1368. The Qubbat-ul-Islam Mosque, stands next to the Qutb Minar. This Mosque is preceded by the Alai-Darwaza-i,A domed gateway decorated with red sandstone and inlaid white marble decorations, inscriptions in Naskh Script and latticed stone screens. This is the first building in India to employ Islamic Architectural principles in its construction and ornamentation. With its pointed arches and spearhead of fringes, identified as lotus buds, it adds grace to the Qubbat-ul-Islam mosque to which it served as an entrance.\n\nThe recent clashes and conflict has seen the site fall into disrepair. Many are calling for it to be a monument to peace and honouring the fallen. This gives us the excuse to rebuild the site to our fitting, no matter what is wanted by the populace"
 ME_Delhi_Events.3.opt1: "Our victories must honour our fallen"
 ME_Delhi_Events.3.opt2: "These monuments are but a testament to Allah"
