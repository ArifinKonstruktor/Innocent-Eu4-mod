Our frontiersmen tell us of immense waterfalls, sizes unseen ever before, and acres of the finest grapes—they exclaim that the natives produce wine finer than our own using unheard of techniques.

 can_cuisines_canada_title: "Cuisines of Canada"
 can_cuisines_canada_desc: "As seen throughout history, people form cultures through bonds that develop in a variety of ways—from possible shared hardships to the language they speak to even the geography of the land. The Canadian identity was founded from all of the above: mutual trauma, two conflicting dominant languages, founded by the geography of our lands, founded by sport and finally our innovations in cuisine. Other ways that people bonded and created cultures was through the invention of unique foods, national sports and games—most specifically on how regions of a country developed their own food.\nFrom once simply being an offshoot of the cultures of the settlers of old, a new identity evolved over the years that unified the Canadian people.\n\nEarly on, Lower Canada adopted traditional tactics of the First Peoples regarding the common maple tree and produced maple syrup, which quickly gained traction among the populace. Montréal developed unique ways to smoke meat and is now renowned for such; within the small towns outside Québéc City came the invention of a dish made from thinly-cut potatoes—following the new phenomenon known by the Belgians as "frieten", but more commonly known as fries—covered in a layer of gravy and then a layer of cheese curds. This popular Québécois dish became syonymous with the region's gastronomy and was eventually dubbed 'poutine'. Moving on, the butter tart came from Upper Canada, and in Niagara came fine wine. All throughout Canada came the maple taffy, and later even more and more sweets came. Cuisine united us together with an identity—finally something for our citizens of all backgrounds to bond over—something to identify with together as Canadians.
