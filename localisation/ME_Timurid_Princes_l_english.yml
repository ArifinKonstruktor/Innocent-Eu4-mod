# Events:
 ME_Timurid_Prince_Event.EVTNAME1: "Fall of the Timurid Empire"
 ME_Timurid_Prince_Event.EVTDESC1: "As the days dutifully pass by, what remains of the Timurid Empire crumbles deeper down into disparity. Scorched earth, ravaged by war, subsides into the annals of history, stepping back to the shadows, for one day a new empire shall rise and take its place, repeating the merciless cycle Timur himself once took part in. Betrayed by ambitious relatives, manipulated by greedy nobles, and led astray by his own ignorance, $MONARCH$'s decrepit empire meets its match at last. The future remains uncertain for Persia."

 ME_Timurid_Prince_Event.EVTDESC2: "As the days grew innumerable, the parched and hunger-stricken forces of Herat began to lose their last flicker of hope. Famine plagued men in likeness to disease, both ravaging each street they galloped throughout the city. The stricken people of the Pearl of Khorasan were under unbearable stress as the weight of heaven itself began pushing down on their shoulders, just as hell rose up to greet their sodden corpses. Surrender was imminent, and the gates of Herat opened to be greeted by an equally tumultuous fate. What once was considered Shah Rukh's golden jewel in the deserts of Persia is now reduced to the ashes and cinder of lost hope, shattered dreams, and a dead city."

 abu_said_mirza_desc: "Born a minor prince of the Timurid dynasty, Abu Sa'id quickly established himself as the most prominent among his warring relations. Over the course of two decades, he reunified much of the Timurid Empire, which had become fractured in the aftermath of the death of his great-uncle Shah Rukh. However, Abu Sa'id's hopes of restoring the empire to its former extent at the time of Timur ultimately failed after he was killed during an invasion of what is now western Iran."
