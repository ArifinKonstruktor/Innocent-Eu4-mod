 ME_Nagpur_Events.1.a: "The Great Reclaimation"
 ME_Nagpur_Events.1.b: "For so long, the people of the holy sites across the subcontinent have toiled away in the midst of Islamic authorities, unable to ensure completely safe passage toward the seven sites. Nagpur has come far in seeing these holy sites reclaimed and renovated for the better with Hindus returning to them without hesitation. Our work to keep places like Ayodhya, Mathura, and Varanasi safe, prosperous, and open to all Hindus from every corner of the world shall not go unnoticed, and our devotion to the gods above will in turn give us the strength we need to go forth and stand against those who would see the subcontinent divided."
 ME_Nagpur_Events.1.c: "May the gods light our way."
 SAPTA_PURI_LOCAL_CENTERS: "§O[This.GetName] will gain rewards at each of the designated sites called tirthas.§!"
 
 #Title of the Event for the tirthas#
 ME_Nagpur_Events.2.a: "A Piece of Sapta Puri"
 
 #Descriptions of each tirtha#
 ME_Nagpur_Events.2.b: "The legendary place where Ramachandra was born, some call it by the name 'Ram Janmabhoomi' meaning 'Rama's birth place'. Ayodhya's significance dates back several centuries as both a political and religious center, though after the fall of Harsha's empire in the 7th-8th century it fell out of political importance to many. Religious activities persisted and this is evident by how many people we see make the journey back toward Ayodhya to witness not only the marvelous buildings but also to pray and pay homage to the temples inside the city."
 ME_Nagpur_Events.2.c: "Mathura has a long and extensive history that many still recount to this day. Popularly known as 'Krishnajanmabhoomi' meaning 'Krishna's birth place', Mathura experienced history dating all the back to the Vedic Period in Indian history but not only this, Muslims as well as Buddhists also call Mathura home as mosques and Buddhist temples can also be found within its limits. Nagpur's careful cultivation and control over Mathura has once again let it thrive freely with Hindus living in relative peace whilst other faiths, though in the minority, still being able to practice as they please."
 ME_Nagpur_Events.2.d: "According to legend, when the Lord Shiva let free the locks of his hair, the goddess Ganga descended unto Haridwar as well. With the name meaning quite literally 'gateway to the god Vishnu', it should come to no surprise that Haridwar is a hub for a great many Hindus from around the subcontinent so that they may take a holy bath in the Ganges and also pray at the various temples around the city. So many legends and tales surround the city itself and now that travel across the subcontinent is increasing to not only Haridwar, but also the other important cities in the Sapta Puri, Nagpur should be ready to embrace this coming age of prosperity."
 ME_Nagpur_Events.2.e: "With a detailed history dating back to the Early and Medieval Cholas, the Pallavas, and even early Buddhism, Kanchipuram serves as a pillar of Hinduism and Jainism. Several Jain acharyas (spiritual teachers) are associated with Kanchipuram and Hindu temples devoted to Shiva and Vishnu can be found here, some dating all the way back the time of the Pallavas. Since Nagpur now holds Kanchipuram in as its own and the temples and communities may be built with the infrastructure support of a strong state, Kanchipuram will flourish from now into the future."
 ME_Nagpur_Events.2.f: "To the credit of Varanasi, it is and has been one of the holiest sites in Hinduism for a very long time with some considering it to be the oldest inhabited city on the subctoninent. From Bhraminical learning in the past to an uncountable richly decorated temples that stood the test of time, Varanasi has been claimed as the favorite city by the Lord Shiva and perhaps even by the administrators of Nagpur itself. Let the people of Varanasi celebrate loudly and with glee, for its holy nature shall be proclaimed all throughout the subcontinent without being held back."
 ME_Nagpur_Events.2.g: "Dwarka is often identified by scholars around the subcontinent with the Dwarka Kingdom from ages past. Dwarka is also said to have been the first capital of Gujarat and as such contains a great amount of signficance to the people of the region and to Hindus from other places. With sevreal majestic temples lining the landscape of Dwarka and the legend of Krishna settling here after killing his uncle, Kansa, being integral to the city, Nagpur is truly honored to have the 'gateway', as its name translates to, become as prosperous as it has."
 ME_Nagpur_Events.2.h: "The tradition of Ujjain stretches back a long way, like many other religious sites encompassed within Sapta Puri, but the key tale for Ujjain is unlike the others. Here, Shiva is said to have triumped over the demon king Triprasura and thusly renamed the city to 'Ujjainyini' or, 'conquers with pride', and is from here that Ujjain gets at least a fair portion of its religious authority. On top of this, the works of Emperor Ashoka helped transform the city into a place of majesty, but this would not last forever unfortunately. Now that peace secure over the region, however, Ujjain may rise once again and become a hub for Hinduism along with its six other fellow sites."

 
 #Tamilakam Events#
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.1.a: "Vijayanagara, the City of Victory"
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.1.b: "The once illustrious city that the Vijayanagara Empire called its home is now ours. Being a haven for Hindu refugees fleeing the Delhi Sultanate in the north from centuries past, Vijayanagara has grown to be a city of great prestige and honor to many and it standing tall has made it a monument against Islam's influence southward and a bastion of Hinduism. To many Hindus in our own lands and elsewhere, the City of Victory is something that no Muslim power should ever be able to destroy.\nTamil warriors and officials have come through to the city to take what they please, but there are some who are advising caution against the looting, saying that doing as such would hamper what could possibly amount to a great center of administration for Tamilakam. Whether or not these cautious people in our ranks are right remains to be seen, but there might be value in having an administrative center further to the north. There is, however, much value to be gained in looting the city entirely and bringing its wealth and much of its populace back to our own capital further south."
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.1.c: "Set the city ablaze and loot it; adorn our capital with what its grandeur."
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.1.d: "Leave it. We have other matters to attend to."
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.1.e: "We can reap better rewards later, if we show compassion now."
 
 
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.2.a: "Bidar, the Center of the Deccan"
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.2.b: "Bidar, once the great city of the Bahmani sultans who broke off from the Delhi sultans far to the north. It has shown great potential for not only agriculture, but also for trade, development, and power as time has gone on. Tamil officials are no fools when it comes to these facts since the Bahmani sultans were in a sense a lingering presence of the wretched Delhi incursions that happened centuries ago toward our homeland; those sultans of the Turquoise Throne had to gather and cement power somewhere and this city was it.\nNow that the Tamil have control of it and now a sizable Muslim minority population within Bidar itself, what shall be done with the city? Burning and looting the city seems like a poor choice to most since it is a great center of trade, and there are many more Muslims in the city than previously anticipated. Still, we can go through with it if we really want to, but other options are certainly available to us."
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.2.c: "It can function on its own with normal care from us."
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.2.d: "Let the city become an impassable wall of stone to any invader."
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.2.e: "We can try to cultivate religious peace and innovative thinking in the city."
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.2.f: "It will be a bastion for Hindus and Jains. Expel the Muslims at once."
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.2.g: "Through Vijayanakar and Pitar, we will guide the Deccan into the future."
 
 
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.3.a: "Delhi, the Seat of Sultans"
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.3.b: "How long has it been since the once mighy sultans of Delhi reached beyond the Narmada River in the Deccan? Centuries... And so far have they fallen away from that once lofty place they were once in. The power that stemmed from Delhi when it was first taken over by Muhammad Ghori after winning the Second Battle of Tarain in 1192, it was greater than so many empires from before. The Gujara-Pratihara from Rajasthan, the Pala Empire that came from Bengal, and even the great Gupta Empire of the past could not compare to the power that the sultans of Delhi cultivated from the 1200s to the middle of the 1400s. That power has now fractured and withered away entirely, leading to our glorious march on the final heart of Muslim power in India as a whole!\nToday, Tamils march through Delhi's streets with triumphal status and great prestige as Hindus have reclaimed the great city for themselves after centuries of turmoil and defeat. The Muslims of Delhi are now fearful of what we might to do them since they are no longer in power and they may indeed be right to have fear in their hearts. Do we put the Muslims and subsequently the city to the sword and fire? Or do we show tolerance to Delhi as a whole and make it a crowning jewel to our conquests?"
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.3.c: "It is a nice city as it is."
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.3.d: "They do not deserve punishment, but rather, compassion and compromise."
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.3.e: "Mosques will be replaced by temples; Muslims will be replaced by Hindus."
 
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.4.a: "Another Tamil Sangam?"
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.4.b: "Centuries upon centuries ago, the Pandya Dynasty hosted the Tamil Sangams, assemblies of scholars and poets alike to compile and produce grand works of literature. Though the First Sangam (dated many thousands of years ago) and the Second Sangam (approximately 4400 years after the first one) are likely mythical and without much validity to them, the Third Sangam (starting some 1850 years before Christanity emerged and going until that point) certainly has validity as the mainstay of Sangam Literature dates to this exact time period. The earliest Tamil literary works date to the Third Sangam which had some 49 members and 449 poets involved and it is described to have been held on the banks of the Pond of Golden Lotuses in the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai.\nSince we have come so far in reclaiming our ancestral lands and reinvigorating Tamil culture throughout Tamilakam, it seems only right that scholars and poets from all over our land are starting to come together once more, petitioning for a new Sangam to be held. The only catch is that, as per tradition, each Sangam is to be held in a different capital location, just as was done in tradition. The First, Second, and Third Sangams were held in different capital cities, the first two being submerged eventually but the last being in what we currently know as Madurai. Do we accept this petition and willingly shift our political capital for these scholars and poets?"
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.4.c: "Patronizing Tamil literature is only right."
 ME_Tamilakam_Events.4.d: "We have different matters to attend to."
 
 
 #Mysore Events#
 ME_Mysore_Events.1.a: "Troubles of Mysore"
 ME_Mysore_Events.1.b: "Whilst we have done what we can to ensure stability and prosperity in Mysore, we have recently come upon hard times and our administration is struggling under the weight of various matters pressing down on it. Our ruler has not been the greatest in dealing with internal politics and our military is looking shaky at best in the eyes of the various castes in Mysore. Many high ranking officials and advisors of both Hinduism and Islam are putting the blame on the Ummatur Dynasty, suggesting that they have failed Mysore as a whole and deserve to be ousted, but would this truly be a wise move? A significant faction is also suggesting that there is a certain rot in the Mysorean administration and that those not loyal to the Ummatur Dynasty need to be expunged at once. Is there really a good choice here?"
 ME_Mysore_Events.1.c: "We can never forsake the Ummatur Dynasty!"
 ME_Mysore_Events.1.d: "It is time to end the decadence of the Ummatur Dynasty!"
 ME_Mysore_Events.1.e: "In these desperate times, perhaps the Muslims can guide us."
 
 ME_Mysore_Events.2.a: "Questions about New Weapons"
 ME_Mysore_Events.2.b: "For a long time now, we have been getting progressively introduced to gunpowder weapons through both trade and through warfare. Gone are the ways of fighting with only a sword and shield with cavalry wings going forth, for we are seeing gunpowder weapons both large and small take the place of skilled swordsmen and heavily armored cavalry. The question coming up is now becoming more and more unavoidable to all of Mysore's administration: Do we attempt to distribute firearms more freely to Mysorean people? Or do we keep it strictly to the military?"
 ME_Mysore_Events.2.c: "If they can load it and fire, they can have one."
 ME_Mysore_Events.2.d: "Quality over quantity is what we stand by."
 
 
 #Deccani Events#
 ME_Deccani_Events.1.a: "The Successor of Bahmanis"
 ME_Deccani_Events.1.b: "With $COUNTRY$ now in firm control of the five pillars of what once held up the Sultanate of Bahmanis, there are few around in the Deccan who are willing to rise up in opposition to us. Our work is far from done and the legacy of our former overlords hailing from Bidar is daunting, but we are merely standing at the start of a great journey. With enough wit, diplomacy, administrative work, and military might, we can succeed in formalizing power in the Deccan and cultivate Deccani culture as it is currently developing."
 ME_Deccani_Events.1.c: "What was once lost, is found once more."
 
 ME_Deccani_Events.2.a: "Victory in the Raichur Doab"
 ME_Deccani_Events.2.b: "Though some on the outside think of our victory in the Raichur Doab as insignificant, in reality it is a turning point for us, a successor of the Sultanate of Bahmanis. For so long it was contested by both those who hailed from the City of Victory in the south and those who hailed from the Turquoise Throne in the north, but there is no question any longer about who is the sole authority in these fertile lands! We, the chosen succesor of Bahmanis, have slain our foe in the fertile lands of the Raichur Doab and driven them out; few will be able to contest our authority in the Deccan once the rest of the splintering southern powers bow to us."
 ME_Deccani_Events.2.c: "Our might is unmatched!"
 
 ME_Deccani_Events.3.a: "Taming of the Deccan Plateau"
 ME_Deccani_Events.3.b: "Defeating our enemies in the north and south has been no easy task. We have lost thousands of soldiers to these recent wars in the Deccan and suffered in our own right, but we have remained firm and steadfast in our ambition to succeed where the Sultanate of Bahmanis failed. In our efforts to defeat the waning power of Hindu dynasties in the south and the various Muslim dynasties of the north, we have been implementing more and more diverse strategies and tactics to conquer our foes since the terrain they call home ranges from thick jungles to towering hills. These skills will not be lost on in the future, and as we take in the population from our defeated enemies, we will take in their military skills, combine them with our own, and learn to placate the entirety of the Deccan with them."
 ME_Deccani_Events.3.c: "Forward unto Dawn."
 
 ME_Deccani_Events.4.a: "The Nizam of the Deccan"
 ME_Deccani_Events.4.b: "With the entirety of the Deccan under our authority, many within our realm have begun to look inward toward the various cities that are deemed to be an essential part of our empire. From cities with great urban growth potential to cities with feeble amounts of luxuries, our viziers as well as the Brahmins we reside over who assist in administrating local communities are coming up with various ways to improve the situation throughout our empire. Some propose much needed land reforms, others support refining how we mint coins, and yet still more vocalize their backing for a number of other reforms that we can take up in the future, but there is one single thread that seems to bind all of these officials together: the need for more cultural unity and cohesion universally. Whether it is through promoting languages in formalized manners or giving legitimacy to the cultural traditions of one group of people that have been looked down upon by us in the past, our Nizam-ul-Mulk (roughly meaning 'Governor of the Realm') needs to see to it that this want for cultural unity is realized."
 ME_Deccani_Events.4.c: "Through cultural unity we will not fall."
 
 ME_Deccani_Events.5.a: "Chowmahalla Palace"
 ME_Deccani_Events.5.b: "Beautiful, is it not? Fitted with a clock tower named the 'Khilwat Clock', a beautifully crafted throne room of pure marble for the Takht-e-Nishan (royal seat) itself, and distinctly Persian style domes and arches, the time and money invested into building up the palace was not wasted in the slightest. Our tireless work conquering and consolidating the various parts of the Deccan has now been formally recognized through out construction of the Chowmahalla Palace. Meaning 'Four Palaces' in the Deccani language that our administration is promoting throughout the region, the ceremonial functions that are necessitated by our dynasty shall be held in great prestige here inside the grandiose halls and rooms. Not only this, but the administration is fit to have its own part of the palatial estate since the growing city of Hyderbad that the palace is built inside of can become a hub for goveranance. As we continue to extend our authority deeper into the communities of the Deccan, and as we continue to strive for excellence in both governing our land and protecting it from invaders, we can rest assured that our prestige and authority will be ingrained in the land through our glorious palace."
 ME_Deccani_Events.5.c: "Al Azmatulillah, all greatness is for God."
