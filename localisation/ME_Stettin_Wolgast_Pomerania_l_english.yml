 STE_stettin_stargard_war_title: "Wheat War"
 STE_stettin_stargard_war_desc: "In 1454, the mutual violation of the conflicting privileges granted to the cities of Stettin and Stargard lead to a military conflict between the two cities. It would be dubbed the 'Wheat War' as the conflicting privileges mandated the wheat trade conducted in the Stettin Lagoon. The cities would wage an open diplomatic war by appealing to the pomeranian rulers. The Hanseatic League was invited to help mediate the conflict and to put an end to the war. It was on a Hanseatic Trial that the conflict ended in 1464."

 POM_seek_greatest_minds_desc: "Boguslaw the Great, the ruler of unified Pomerania, had embarked on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1496. On his way back, the Duke paid a visit to the Pope, who granted him the occupation right to the Cammin Bishopric among other benefits.

 POM_greifswald_university_desc: "In 1456, Pope Callixtus the Third, leader of the Catholic Church, has enacted a bull that brought the Greifswald University to life. That success can be attributed to the great dedication of Heinrich Rugenow, mayor of Greifswald, and the efforts of Warcislaw the Ninth, the at-the-time Duke of Wolgast-Pomerania. Thanks to the ties the city had with the Hanseatic League, the University managed to bring together many great minds not just from Northern Germany, but also from Scandinavia. The institution is one of the oldest of its kind in Germany, having been founded only after a handful of other universities."

That has lead to the Landtag in Treptow, a meeting that would decide the future of the Pomeranian Duchy. The Landtag took place in December of 1534 and estates of the realm were called in to participate. In favor of embracing protestantism were the burghers, which were at odds with the clergy, and the rulers of Pomerania, who saw the protestant reformation as an opportunity to secularize and thus seize the lands of bishops and monasteries. On the opposing side were the nobles and the clergy, both of which preferred Pomerania stayed in unity with rome. The opposition was lead by the Bishop of Cammin, Erasmus von Manteuffel-Arnhausen. Despite the fierce resistance, the dukes of Pomerania adopted Protestantism and publicly announced their conversion. This marked the beginning of the creation of Pomeranian Evangelical Church."
