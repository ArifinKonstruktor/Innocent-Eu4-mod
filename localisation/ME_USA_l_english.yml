 usa_confederacy: "Articles of Confederation"
 desc_usa_confederacy: "The Articles of Confederation, ratified in 1781, made up the majority of the US constitution for nearly a decade. They spelled out an extremely weak central government and an emphasis on the states' authority rather than the federal. Primarily supported by antifederalists, the articles were a severe hinderance to the nation as a whole."
 usa_federation: "The American Constitution"
 desc_usa_federation: "The Absolute Law of the Land, the United States Constitution spells out the American way in lamens terms, with a strong central government to defend the liberties of the people, as well as a simple legislative body that offers representation to all states on relatively equal terms."
