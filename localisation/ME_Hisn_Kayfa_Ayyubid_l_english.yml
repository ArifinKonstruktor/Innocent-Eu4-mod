What falls shall rise once more. So easily one forgets of beauty; it leaves the mind as it leaves the earth. The azure rumblings of the waves shall reach these shores once more, for the sea once again has reason to rise and fall. The pitiful, vile, conniving slaves made haste to their downfall; for this we might thank the Lord.
