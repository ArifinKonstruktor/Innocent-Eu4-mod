 ME_Ayyubid_Events.3.d: "From the busied burghers, bustling about in Aleppo, to the fickle fiends of Dimashq, our banner soars brightly, shining as not only our guiding star, but as our monument to victory, to glory; it gallantly gallops to and fro', a testament to the tenacity of man. What falls shall rise once more. So easily one forgets of beauty; it leaves the mind as it leaves the earth. The azure rumblings of the waves shall reach these shores once more, for the sea once again has reason to rise and fall. The pitiful, vile, conniving slaves made haste to their downfall; for this we might thank the Lord. Needn't the people of Syria worry again, for we have returned to this seemingly barren land; of course, the naked eye sees not what is despises. A happy people, a fruitful people, resides upon these rolling dunes, prepared to celebrate the triumphant return of its lord."
