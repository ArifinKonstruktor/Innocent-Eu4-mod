 ANS_margraves_palace_desc: "Some of the previous rulers that were the suzerains of Ansbach have expanded the Stiftshof into a water castle, but this simple building will not be enough to glorify the dynasty of Ansbach. It's high time we fund a building to praise the achievements of the Franconian Hohenzollerns."

 ANS_Ansbach_porcelain_desc: "Not so long after Johann Friedrich Böttger finally discovered the secret of producing porcelain, many porcelain manufactories sprung up across Europe, the most prominent among them being the Meissner porcelain manufactories. If we appeal to the Saxons, we may be able to exploit this knowledge and create manufactories of our own."
