 ME_Manchu_Events.1.t: "The Secret of Ginseng"
 ME_Manchu_Events.1.d: "Trade with the Ming has unveiled their people's great propensity for tea and ginseng. Fortunately, the techniques of ginseng cultivation have been well known to us for ages. It's time to start up those farms!"
 ME_Manchu_Events.1.a: "[ginseng_province.GetName] is an excellent candidate for new farms."
 ME_Manchu_Events.1.b: "The capital will be better!"
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.2.t: "Rise of the Jiu Han Jun"
 ME_Manchu_Events.2.d: "Our military conquests of China have fared well for us, but our strategic use of propaganda against the Ming has reaped greater benefits than we could have ever imagined! The Ming bureaucrats did not favor their military, fearing that the officers would become too influential... It was only logical that we would use this weakness against the Ming and let it be known that their skills would be appreciated under Manchu rule. Defectors were promised leading positions underneath the new government, as well as royal marriages with Manchu nobility.\n\nThis should certainly be enough to sweeten the deal..."
 ME_Manchu_Events.2.a: "Is that a revolt I hear?"
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.3.t: "Great Jin Proclaimed"
 ME_Manchu_Events.3.d: "The growing strength of the Manchu nation has given us a greater ambitions. We much challenge the Ming, and face our destiny as future rulers of China. The Mandate of Heaven is all but lost for them..."
 ME_Manchu_Events.3.a: "We will rule from Liaoning."
 ME_Manchu_Events.3.b: "The ancestral lands of Girin are adequate."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.4.t: "The Seven Grievances"
 ME_Manchu_Events.4.d: "Announced by the founding Khan, Naruhaci, on May 7, 1618, the Seven Grievances were a list of crimes perpetrated by the Ming against the Manchu. They were as follows:\n\n1. The Ming killed Nurhaci's father and grandfather without reason\n\n2. The Ming suppressed Jianzhou and favored Yehe and Hada clans\n\n3. The Ming violated agreement of territories with Nurhac\n\n4. The Ming sent troops to protect Yehe against Jianzhou\n\n5. The Ming supported Yehe to break its promise to Nurhaci\n\n6. The Ming forced Nurhaci to give up the lands in Chaihe, Sancha and Fuan\n\n7. The Ming's official Shang Bozhi abused his power and rode roughshod over the people."
 ME_Manchu_Events.4.a: "The wheels of history turn."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.5.t: "Siezure of Liaoning"
 ME_Manchu_Events.5.d: "With one of the eighteen key forts of the Ming captured at Fushun, Liaoning is all but ours."
 ME_Manchu_Events.5.a: "Manchuria united!"
 ME_Manchu_Events.5.b: "Shore up the defenses at Fushun; we won't make the same mistake!"
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.6.t: "A Written Language for The Manchu People"
 ME_Manchu_Events.6.d: "The Jurchen Script has been in use by the Jurchen tribes since at least the 1100's, but the native written language has gradually fallen out of favor to be replaced by the neighboring Mongol's written word; another minority have taken up the Chinese system instead. Should we preserve our native word and improve upon it, or adopt a more pragmatic approach?"
 ME_Manchu_Events.6.a: "We will create the Manchu Script."
 ME_Manchu_Events.6.b: "We will adopt the Mongol custom."
 ME_Manchu_Events.6.c: "We Will adopt the Chinese custom."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.7.t: "The Mandate of Heaven"
 ME_Manchu_Events.7.d: "The Mandate of Heaven is an institution which goes back to even the Ancient times of China. Over the course of the years, many rules and conquerors have come to lose and claim it. The wheels of time have turned once again, and the Heavens have deemed the Ming incapable of ruling China. It is obvious who they favor... but should we take up the Mantle and rule as the Son of Heaven, or reject these ideals and rule as Khan?"
 ME_Manchu_Events.7.b: "Out with the old, in with the new! I am the Khan!"
 ME_Manchu_Events.7.a: "A new Age has begun for China! I am the Son of Heaven!"
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.8.t: "Employ the Wokou"
 ME_Manchu_Events.8.d: "The Wokou Pirates were a feared group amongst the traders of the Ming. Since they operated from a then distant land, they could not be controlled... "
 ME_Manchu_Events.8.a: "Hire them into the Manchu navies."
 ME_Manchu_Events.8.b: "Pirates are too unruly to control."
 MCH_JAPAN_PIRATES: "Ban on Japanese Piracy"
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.9.t: "Hire the Ronin"
 ME_Manchu_Events.9.d: "In Japan, there is a class of warrior known as the Ronin. They ae wandering vagrants, who brought dishonor upon themselves. though they hold a lowly place under their former regime, they are still skilled warriors - dishonored or not..."
 ME_Manchu_Events.9.a: "They shall join our ranks!"
 ME_Manchu_Events.9.b: "How can we trust them if they cannot even obey their own masters?"
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.10.t: "Conscript the Ainu"
 ME_Manchu_Events.10.d: "The Ainu are knowledgeable in many ways of living in the coldest and harshest climates. Though such rough lands are nothing new to our Manchu Bannermen, it won't hurt to send them off to educate the foreign bannermen."
 ME_Manchu_Events.10.a: "Excellent idea."

 ME_Manchu_Events.11.t: "China Secured"
 ME_Manchu_Events.11.d: "The historical lands of China have finally been wrested from the grasp of the Ming. We can now rest easy and shore up the borders of the heartland... but not for too long!"
 ME_Manchu_Events.11.a: "The best offense is a good defense, after all."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.12.t: "The Japanese Eight Banners"
 ME_Manchu_Events.12.d: "The continual expansion of the Banner system has been pivotal to our military organization. What once began as four doubled to the Manchu Eight Banners, then eight more added as the Mongol Eight banners, and eight more again, with the Han Eight Banners; together these twenty-four banners represented the three main ethnicities of the new Manchu Empire. The annexation of Japan has swelled our ranks once more, and perhaps it is once again time to expand the Banner system." 
 ME_Manchu_Events.12.a: "Create the Japanese Eight Banners!"
 ME_Manchu_Events.12.b: "Our ranks are large enough as it is!"
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.13.t: "Expansion Beyond the Seas"
 ME_Manchu_Events.13.d: "Many great and rich islands lie untouched in Nanyang. Tales of mountains of Spices, Gems, Gold, and even a virgin landmass as large as China. We cannot be satisfied with the known world; we must go forth into the unknown!"
 ME_Manchu_Events.13.a: "To the Seas!"
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.14.t: "The Han Eight Banners"
 ME_Manchu_Events.14.d: "Our repeated victories and incursions into the Ming mean more and more recruit able Han men. As it stands, the Banners have only grown to accommodate our Mongol brethren... but what's eight more?"
 ME_Manchu_Events.14.a: "The more the merrier!"
 ME_Manchu_Events.14.b: "We can't lower our standards..."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.15.t: "The Mongol Eight Banners"
 ME_Manchu_Events.15.d: "Our expansion into the wild steppes have brought with it the assimilation of the Mongol nomads who inhabit it. While fierce and certainly with a reputation, it would not be wise to haphazardly mix them amongst our people. Perhaps we should create a similar Banner system for the Mongols who serve us?"
 ME_Manchu_Events.15.a: "An excellent idea!"
 ME_Manchu_Events.15.b: "There's no need for that..."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.16.t: "Reform the Six Ministries"
 ME_Manchu_Events.16.d: "As the Qing evolved into a full fledged state, their system of government was adopted from the former Ming's own government; the bureaucratic functions were kept mostly intact with the simple but significant caveat that they were split amongst ethnic lines. The Qing split appointments between Manchu, Han, and occasional Mongol officials. Beyond this, the Qing government relegated specific tasks to the divisions of the Six Ministries. These departments handled routine affairs assumed in running a large state."
 ME_Manchu_Events.16.a: "The hiring process needs some work."
 reformed_ministry_personnel_tooltip: "Begin the '§YReforming the Ministry of Personnel§!' event chain."
 ME_Manchu_Events.16.b: "Taxes!"
 reformed_ministry_revenue_tooltip: "Begin the '§YReforming the Ministry of Revenue§!' event chain."
 ME_Manchu_Events.16.c: "Tributaries don't run themselves!"
 reformed_ministry_rites_tooltip: "Begin the '§YReforming the Ministry of Rites§!' event chain."
 ME_Manchu_Events.16.e: "Military logistics can't be ignored!"
 reformed_ministry_war_tooltip: "Begin the '§YReforming the Ministry of War§!' event chain."
 ME_Manchu_Events.16.f: "We should sort out the laws."
 reformed_ministry_justice_tooltip: "Begin the '§YReforming the Ministry of Justice§!' event chain."
 ME_Manchu_Events.16.g: "It's time to get to building!"
 reformed_ministry_works_tooltip: "Begin the '§YReforming the Ministry of Works§!' event chain."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.17.t: "New Regulations for the Ministry of Personnel"
 ME_Manchu_Events.17.d: "The bureaucracy has evolved and the meritocratic examination system has become all but the sole determination for hiring practices. While this is excellent for maintaining a high quality of those we employ, the process is quite cumbersome. Particularly, the backlog of hires has become inundated with readers-in-waiting, mentors, and officials of lower qualification. A court advisor has suggested that we should not waste these talents to waiting, and instead send them off to lower administrative positions such as provincial magistrates."
 ME_Manchu_Events.17.a: "An excellent idea!"
 ME_Manchu_Events.17.b: "Doing so would only undermine our bureaucracies."
 completed_ministry_personnel_chain_tooltip: "The '§YReforming the Ministry of Personnel§!' event chain is §Gconcluded§!."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.18.t: "Compiling the Kai Lie"
 ME_Manchu_Events.18.d: "A great empire cannot be governed by only a single Emperor; as such, it is one of the key skills of the Emperor to appropriately delegate tasks. Near the top of the hierarchy is the governing of provinces and their adjacent roles. In the era of the Ming, the practice of appointing these roles were done via 'collective recommendation,' hui tui. This process was carried out by members of a Ministry wherein they recommended someone to be appointed. While it built loyalty among peers, it was also subject to viscous factionalism.\nThe Board of Personnel have proposed an alternative system, ranked lists, or 'kai lei'; upon the vacancy of each position, officials create a list of all eligible candidates, ranked by qualification. The Board recommends that we try to distance ourselves from the old bureaucracy."
 ME_Manchu_Events.18.a: "An unbiased rule is necessary for an efficient bureaucracy."
 ME_Manchu_Events.18.b: "This seems rather complicated."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.19.t: "The Specialization of Posts"
 ME_Manchu_Events.19.d: "The administration of the Qing is based on classical Confucian ideals - which say that passing examinations and studying the required texts is the sole qualifier for service. It has come to our attention that strict adherence to such ideals may serve a hindrance to our government. The roles of a governor and his subordinates can vary greatly and to treat each role and position the same in every province is a disservice to the particular details of truly governing the locals. As such, the Board of Personnel has suggested that we should consider allowing for governors to choose and appoint regional and local experts at their discretion to aid them. While this will grant greater autonomy to gubernatorial positions, the Emperor still reserves the right to pick, choose, and eject as he pleases."
 ME_Manchu_Events.19.a: "An interesting proposal..."
 ME_Manchu_Events.19.b: "Our current system will suffice."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.20.t: "Specialization of Posts in [Root.GetName]"
 ME_Manchu_Events.20.d: "The roles of an expert are not to be understated! One highly qualified individual can make all the difference between smooth operation and an ineffective bureaucracy. The governor  of [Root.GetName] has come to decide how best to orient the resources afforded to him."
 ME_Manchu_Events.20.a: "Shore up the defenses, there are enemies out there!"
 ME_Manchu_Events.20.b: "We should support the farmers of [Root.GetName]."
 ME_Manchu_Events.20.c: "Supporting the traders will bring wealth to [Root.GetName]."
 ME_Manchu_Events.20.e: "Shift focus to the capital city of [Root.GetCapitalName]."
 ME_Manchu_Events.20.f: "Efforts are required elsewhere."
 ME_Manchu_Events.20.g: "Nothing wrong with the current deal."
 ME_Manchu_Events.20.h: "An knowledges expert in the local faith would be useful..."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.21.t: "Matters of Coinage"
 ME_Manchu_Events.21.d: "The Office of the Mint is administered directly by the Ministry of Revenue; to maintain stable circulation of currency, we mint specific quotas of coins, produced from copper and lead in Yunnan, Guangnan, and Hunan. Thus far, this has proved to be an effective way to manage the circulation of, however a small subset of the Board has brought to our attention the concerns of a growing population. They advise an increase in the minting of coins to maintain parity with growth. Others fear that our over reliance on copper and lead will weaken the economy in the long term."
 ME_Manchu_Events.21.a: "Up the quotas."
 ME_Manchu_Events.21.b: "Hold."
 ME_Manchu_Events.21.c: "Slow down minting."
 completed_ministry_revenue_chain_tooltip: "The '§YReforming the Ministry of Revenue§!' event chain is §Gconcluded§!."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.22.t: "Silks, Dyes, and Paper"
 ME_Manchu_Events.22.d: "The Ministry of Revenue controls a number of smaller administrative units. Two of these are the Silk and Linen Store, and the Dyes and Paper Store, in charge of handling fabrics from provincial tribute and handling paints, dyes, paper, and vermilion for use in-office, respectively.\nBefore its fall, the Ming had developed a lucrative set of imperial silk factories in the Jiangning region. Although they have fallen into disrepair, their restoration should be doable with enough funding. ...Similarly, the great paper mills of Southern China have have become derelict due to the war, however their restoration would also cost a considerable investment."
 ME_Manchu_Events.22.a: "Spare no expense!"
 ME_Manchu_Events.22.b: "We can only afford to restore the silk factories."
 ME_Manchu_Events.22.c: "We can only afford to restore the paper mills."
 ME_Manchu_Events.22.e: "But our coffers!"
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.23.t: "Implementing the Sheng-k'o"
 ME_Manchu_Events.23.d: "The landscape of China is, quite literally, always changing. Landslides, erosion, and agricultural activity constantly re-appropriate land to nature, and farmers back to man, and that is immutable. However, so is taxation... from the many tasks of the Board of Revenue, collecting taxes is the primary function. The quality and quantity of taxable land is not one-size-fits-all, and treating it as such would only prove incompetence. As such, we should judge land taxation on a case-by-case basis: exemptions for fields in fallow, reduced taxes for damaged lands, and regular rechecking of plots."
 ME_Manchu_Events.23.a: "Sounds reasonable..."
 ME_Manchu_Events.23.b: "It could be expensive... Find a generalized tax rate."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.24.t: "Costly Tributary Visits"
 ME_Manchu_Events.24.d: "A great many kingdoms and states reognize the supremacy of the Qing Empire and willingly pay tribute to the Emperor. Depending on the subject, they may send an envoy to [Root.Capital.GetName] annually or perhaps every five years. Being the prosperous empire that we are, it is expected that we should recieve these guests with proper hospitality. Great gifts are exchanged on behalf of these visiting dignitaries and lavish accomodations are provided; neither of these come free. It has come to the attention of the Board of Rites that these expenses are contiuning to mount..."
 ME_Manchu_Events.24.a: "Call for a reduction of tributary visits."
 ME_Manchu_Events.24.b: "No need to be so stingy."
 qng_sometimes_envoy_events: "Occassional envoy events will occur"
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.25.t: "Invasion of Taiwan"
 ME_Manchu_Events.25.d: "Several former Ming princes tried to hold onto the land, but were overrun by out might. The dozen or so remaining princes were treated with honor and were sent to live out their lives in the capital. While that may suffice for the nobility, the people are another story, as they look on their new overlords with suspicion. Perhaps we can extend an offer of peace to them?"
 ME_Manchu_Events.25.a: "No need to spill more blood."
 ME_Manchu_Events.25.b: "They are our subjects now. Further resistance is an act of treason."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.26.t: "Rule of the Dalai Lama"
 ME_Manchu_Events.26.d: "The Mountains of Tibet and the great city of Lhasa has been ruled by kings and khans of ages past. The difficulty of holding the rough territories has lead foreign rulers to rule by proxy with great autonomy. The spiritual and political leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama, has recognized our might and voluntarily offered to become a tribute under the Emperor. While a generous offer, this would effectively grant the Dalai Lama total rule in Tibet - a risky proposition. It could be to our advantage to fragment political power within Tibet amongst their own leadership and instead install a Panchen Lama, the defacto second highest authority of Tibet."
 ME_Manchu_Events.26.a: "We should keep a short leash."
 ME_Manchu_Events.26.b: "We will accept the offer of the Dalai Lama."
 ME_Manchu_Events.26.c: "What a headache..."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.27.t: "Translating the Manchu Tongue"
 ME_Manchu_Events.27.d: "It was obvious that the Koreans did not enjoy us as their new overlords, but they dared not resist any further, if not for the sake of their countrymen. In an effort to normalize relations with the Qing court, the Joseon court quickly went to work on training Korean-Manchu translators. Trained in both Jurchen Script and Hangul, these new translators should ease relations somewhat."
 ME_Manchu_Events.27.a: "Sounds great! We think... We don't really know Korean well."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.28.t: "Lifting the Seaban"
 ME_Manchu_Events.28.d: "During the invasion of the Ming, we had to keep a close eye on the outgoing and ingoing ships, as they may have been instruments to revolt. Times have changed now, and Ming loyalists are no more. With newfound stability, we may finally start looking outwards, reaching past the seas to lands beyond, hoping they will bring to us their wealth and riches.\n\nThe ports are open!"
 ME_Manchu_Events.28.a: "Sort of..."
 qng_gets_custom_houses_tt: "Gets province triggered-modifier '§YCustoms House§!' until the end of the game."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.29.t: "Rule over the Basin"
 ME_Manchu_Events.29.d: "The Mongols of the Tarim Basin are a resistant and pugnacious people. They previously threatened the security of the mainland in the East, often raiding the border. Upon the defeat of the regional leaders, a former khan stepped forward, offering his loyalty in exchange for the autonomy and administration of the Tarim Basin and surrounding regions. We could accept him as an un-elevated khan, responsible for collecting tribute and handing our rightful portion to us; or granting him the lands and allowing him direct administration; or simply not obliging."
 ME_Manchu_Events.29.a: "Keep him close, but not too close."
 ME_Manchu_Events.29.b: "A military governate should be in order."
 ME_Manchu_Events.29.c: "Bah! Settle the lands, WE conquered it!"
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.30.t: "Diplomacy with [1020.Owner.GetName]"
 ME_Manchu_Events.30.d: "The Shogun of Japan is the de-facto ruler of the island, presiding as the military governor over several subordinate lords. Their focus on military rule has caused relations between China and Japan to be limited. Missions to the Shogun's court have recently proven successful and diplomatic channels are now being established via the Kingdom of Ryukyu, and the Joseon Court. The first true order of business is to being importing much needed silver from the island..."
 ME_Manchu_Events.30.a: "Send the junks!"
 ME_Manchu_Events.30.b: "Send the Junks!"
 ME_Manchu_Events.30.c: "Build an embassy!"
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.31.t: "Treaty of Nerchinsk"
 ME_Manchu_Events.31.d: "Traditionally, the Chinese Empire has relied on the political philosophy of a sino-centric model, wherein all other nations are subject to the Son of Heaven. It appears this model can no longer be stringently followed as powerful nations of the West are beginning to make headway on the global stage. The Russian Empire is one of these powerful European powers whose Siberian settlements have finally come into regular contact with our northern extremities. After minor skirmishes and diplomatic missions, representatives of the Tsar and the Emperor have met to draw up a treaty in the common tongue of Latin. Hopefully, this agreement will prevent future large-scale conflicts between our great nations, but only time will tell..."
 ME_Manchu_Events.31.a: "We should avoid bloodshed."
 ME_Manchu_Events.31.b: "This is unacceptable, all must accept the superiority of the Qing."
 qng_treaty_tt: "The treaty will be renewed every 5 years."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.32.t: "Renewing the Treaty of Nerchinsk"
 ME_Manchu_Events.32.d: "Times change, and after reassessing the political climate, we should examine whether or not this treaty is still to our favor. "
 ME_Manchu_Events.32.a: "Keep the peace."
 ME_Manchu_Events.32.b: "We reject this agreement."
 qng_no_renew: "An era of peace has ended..."

 ME_Manchu_Events.33.t: "Importing Silver"
 ME_Manchu_Events.33.d: "Silver flows in from foreign markets through the ports at Manila, silver that is sorely needed to bolster the Chinese economy. Luckily, our previous preparations in choosing monetary policies have finally come to fruition, and now that a steady stream of precious metals are now entering the Chinese economy it is only a matter of time before we can being reaping its rewards."
 ME_Manchu_Events.33.a: "Who knew inflation could be a positive?"
 ME_Manchu_Events.33.b: "Controlling the currency seems to have paid off."
 ME_Manchu_Events.33.c: "Our coins are now regarded much more favorably in foreign markets."

 ME_Manchu_Events.34.t: "Modernizing the Examinations"
 ME_Manchu_Events.34.d: "Traditionally, the Examination system has relied heavily on knowledge of the Confucian Classics, touching somewhat on current events, politics, and history; meanwhile, military examinations rely on classical tactics and archery. Recent developments have meant that foreign influences from the West, the Steppes, and the Subcontinent have begun to creep into Chinese society. No longer are the Chinese classics the only relevant knowledge. Firearms are becoming ever more commonplace, foreign religions such as Christianity and Islam are finding followers here in China, and innovative new technologies are being invented constantly."
 ME_Manchu_Events.34.a: "Me must retain traditional values."
 ME_Manchu_Events.34.b: "Some updated topics can't hurt."
 qng_new_exams_flag_tt: "We will investigate these new ideas."

 ME_Manchu_Events.35.t: "Milk Tea and Gong Cha"
 ME_Manchu_Events.35.d: "Gong Cha, or the imperial tea, is a special brand of tea granted special favor amongst the imperial court of China. Legend has it that the emperor was presented a cup of Longjing Tea, or Dragonwell Tea, at the Hu Gong Temple. The Emperor was so impressed with this tea that he granted the eighteen tea bushes at the Temple the status of Gong Cha. The tea has now become popularized all over China; the original eighteen bushes now produce tea valued more than their weight in gold.\n\nElsewhere, the Manchu practice of adding milk to tea has begun to catch on with foreigners. The Han natives of China may have no great love for milk tea, but it seems that we can sell this to others."
 ME_Manchu_Events.35.a: "Mmm. I could go for a cup of tea now."
 qng_milk_tea_tt: "\nIf fortune permits, perhaps we can reach out to new markets?"

 ME_Manchu_Events.36.t: "Popularization of Milk Tea"
 ME_Manchu_Events.36.d: "Brought to the Chinese Court by the Manchu people, milk tea became the choice tea of Qing Emperors, even after they had been fully sinicized. Originally laced with fermented mare's milk, it has now spread in popularity with Western foreigners who make heavy use of cow's milk. The drink is said to have spread to many parts of Europe - and even the Americas - where it's medicinal qualities are advertised."
 ME_Manchu_Events.36.a: "How enlightened of them!"

 ME_Manchu_Events.37.t: "Proliferation of Opium"
 ME_Manchu_Events.37.d: "How strange it is that such a small plant could produce such incredible effects on man. During the Ming, it was regarded as an aphrodisiac, before that it was known to preserve Qi. Now, we simply know it to be a simple pleasure drug, a white tar-like poison.\n\nAnd what are poisons used for?"
 ME_Manchu_Events.37.a: "Opium consumption does not abide to Confucian principles."
 ME_Manchu_Events.37.b: "We would be left behind if we restrict their domestic sales."

 ME_Manchu_Events.38.t: "Opium Epidemic in [Root.GetName]"
 ME_Manchu_Events.38.d: "Recent trends of consumption and trade have lead to a large influx of opium into our country. Men, women, and shockingly even children partake in the smoking of this new and volatile drug. What was once a past-time for the few, the old, and the infirm, has become cheap and plentiful. Smoking houses are on the rise, and many a subject has been reduced to vegetative states in those dank and sickly dens."
 ME_Manchu_Events.38.a: "We have to pass laws! Ban it, tax it, do something!"
 ME_Manchu_Events.38.b: "Punish its use. By force!"
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.39.t: "Global Opium Epidemic"
 ME_Manchu_Events.39.d: "What started as a simple market endeavor has snowballed out of control beyond our wildest expectations. It is as it is..."
 ME_Manchu_Events.39.a: "Oh dear..."
 qng_global_opium: "\n§YYikes!§!"
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.40.t: "Burmese Military Frontier"
 ME_Manchu_Events.40.d: "The jungles of Burma are a wild and untameable land. The Ming, great Chinese states before them found great difficulty in completely pacifying the kings of Burma. Following the campaign to secure Burma, regional governors of Xinan have examined the region with great interest. They claim that direct governance would be ideal, as it would lead to better response times to the region, while members of our court advise that an independent, but subjugant, Burma would be the ideal situation, as the difficulties of administrating the region all the way from the capital are known. "
 ME_Manchu_Events.40.a: "Military rule should keep them in line."
 ME_Manchu_Events.40.b: "Establish them as a tribute."
 ME_Manchu_Events.40.c: "The governors will sort things out."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.41.t: "Vietnamese Subjects"
 ME_Manchu_Events.41.d: "The relationship between Dai Viet and the Chinese Empire has always been tenuous one, subject to the whims of the rulers of either country. We wish to maintain an amicable relation, as an invasion of Vietnam would be costly to both sides."
 ME_Manchu_Events.41.a: "Open direct diplomatic channels."
 ME_Manchu_Events.41.b: "Maintain the current tributary status."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.42.t: "State Monopoly on Salt"
 ME_Manchu_Events.42.d: "After the conquest of Ming, the Qing court seized control of major salt production locations. To alleviate administrative responsibilities from the Qing government, the Qing appointed merchants to manage salt transportation and licenses. Although the salt monopoly is run by government officially, whether or not it operates smoothly is dependent on cooperation of the Merchants."
 ME_Manchu_Events.42.a: "Lets keep them in good graces then."
 qng_salt_station_tt: "Every owned §Ysalt§! province receives triggered-modifier '§YSalt Stations§!' until the end of the game."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.43.t: "New Salt Stations in [Root.GetName]"
 ME_Manchu_Events.43.d: "Our new expansion seems to have a granted us access to new salt stores. Time to hand them off to the proper merchants."
 ME_Manchu_Events.43.a: "Excellent!"
 qng_salt_station_tt2: "[Root.GetName] gets receives triggered-modifier '§YSalt Stations§!' until the end of the game."

 ME_Manchu_Events.44.t: "Great Envoys from [qng_big_tribute_target.GetName]"
 ME_Manchu_Events.44.d: "Envoys from [qng_big_tribute_target.GetName] have arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName] bearing their annual tribute. They have arrived with a full escort of royal servants and and all number of extravagant decorations. The court servants do their duties diligently and greet them in kind, but ministers - especially those well aware of the finances - may have something to say of this."
 ME_Manchu_Events.44.a: "It's clear they've made an effort to come here, we should return the favor."
 ME_Manchu_Events.44.b: "The pageantry is appreciated, but it was their choice."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.45.t: "Huang Zongxi, Neo-Confucian Philosopher"
 ME_Manchu_Events.45.d: "Huang Zongxi was born under the rule of the Ming, and so developed his philosophies on Ming-Era Neo-Confucian teachings. His greatest work 'Mingyi Daifang Lu' is quite clearly a targeted attack on our new regime; the work accuses and implicates the Manchu rulers as partaking in selfish rule. His other works build on older theories, such as hypothesizing that the 'li', Universal Order, and 'qi', are inseperable concepts. Therefore, Man, as a creation of 'li', and as an independent Being, leads to the conclusion that Matter must be able to control itself, and therefore must be in possession of 'li', Universal Principle."
 ME_Manchu_Events.45.a: "What a fascinating idea."
 ME_Manchu_Events.45.b: "Did you say dissenter?"

 ME_Manchu_Events.46.t: "Gu Yanwu, Philosopher of the Classics"
 ME_Manchu_Events.46.d: "Gu Yanwu was a prolific writer and thinker within the Ming-Era. Inspired by the weak and ineffective government of the Ming, he traced many of the systematic issues to Neo-Confucian philosophies invented during mid-Ming Era, and subsequently rejected them. He emphasized that true Confucian Scholars should learn the Classics, 'jingxue', and that reviving the studies of the Classics with modern methods would produce new and innovative exegesis. His works and criticisms inspired a great many other thinkers and opened the intellectual world's proverbial floodgates for new interpretations and discussion.\n\n All under Heaven, from one's one person to familiar and state affairs, can and must be based on studying and learning the Classical writings. And all social relationships and interactions are founded on the principle of self-restriction and modesty.\n~Analects"
 ME_Manchu_Events.46.a: "We could do with new ideas like that."
 ME_Manchu_Events.46.b: "This man seems to have no interest in serving the court."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.47.t: "Wang Fuzhi, The First Materialist"
 ME_Manchu_Events.47.d: "Unlike his contemporaries, Wang Fuzhi utterly rejected and systematically undermined each aspect of Neo-Confucian philosophy. He argued that Reality is what is visible and hearable, and that they dominate the Heavenly Way. He also proposed that all material things are subject to Perpetual Flux, a concept which extends to human Character; this is in contrast with the traditional Confucian view that humanity is naturally Good - as Fuzhi's philosophy implies that that is not set in stone. Beyond this, Fuzhi preached utilitarianism with respect to the Confucian understanding of Knowledge - arguing that knowledge without action is useless, and that action is of greater importance."
 ME_Manchu_Events.47.a: "I'd like to hear more..."
 ME_Manchu_Events.47.b: "How... disharmonius."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.48.t: "The Three Great Early Qing Philosophers"
 ME_Manchu_Events.48.d: "Li Yong, Sun Qifeng, and Huang Zongxi are together known as the Three Great Early Qing Philosophers. While they approach the subject with different theories, it seems they will have a great impact on the future of Confucian philosophy and its discourse within the Qing Empire. Li Yong, sees Confucian writings as handbooks and guidelines for policy making. Sun Qifeng is regarded as one of the masters of Confucian Ethics, and and his work on 'Four Books' is recommend by disciples, and likely will be well into the future. Huang Zongxi was one of the first Neo-Confucian scholars to stress the need for constitutional law in the empire, the need to be able to criticize the Emperor, and that the Emperor should respect the concerns of his subordinates."
 ME_Manchu_Events.48.a: "Handbooks, eh?"
 ME_Manchu_Events.48.b: "What advancements in ethics have been made?"
 ME_Manchu_Events.48.c: "Tell me about this 'constitutional law'."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.49.t: "Yan Yuan and Li Gong, Critics of Impracticality"
 ME_Manchu_Events.49.d: "Yan Yuan and his disciple Li Gong, are outspoken critics of the Song-to-Ming Era of Neo-Confucian philosophy. They criticize past philosophies for being useless and unusable in real life and government - that scholars of Neo-Confucian philosophies were too stuck in their books and studies to contribute to political an militaristic affairs. They want the state to focus on building great projects, rearing great generals, and employing by great merit, rather than judging character value on scholarly pursuits."
 ME_Manchu_Events.49.a: "Hire the elder, I would like to know more."
 ME_Manchu_Events.49.b: "Hire the younger, I would like to know more."
  
 ME_Manchu_Events.50.t: "Hui Dong, Scholar of the Han Classics"
 ME_Manchu_Events.50.d: "Hui Dong and his father, and his father's father, have spent many years reinterpreting the Confucian Classics. They consider Classics from the even the Song and Tang eras too far removed from Confucius' original teachings. Hui Dong thinks the truth could only be discerned by reading the then-newest commentaries of Confucian writings. He believes that Han-Era writers were recent enough that they still had knowledge of the original meanings of the Classics."
 ME_Manchu_Events.50.a: "What can we learn from our ancestors?"
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.51.t: "Dai Zhen, Confucian Fundamentalist"
 ME_Manchu_Events.51.d: "Dai Zhen seeks to reach the core philosophies of Confucius. He actively attempts to separate Daoist and Bhuddhist influences from the core Confucian beliefs, even going so far as to claim that Han-Era writings on Confucianism were already too far removed from Confucius himself. One of his major focuses is the emphasis on Human Affects, which says that desires are part of human nature, opposing the traditional Neo-Confucian interpretation that Human Desire is opposite to Heavenly Order."
 ME_Manchu_Events.51.a: "Finally someone who appreciates the Classic Classic Classics."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.52.t: "Bada Shanren, Prodigy Painter"
 ME_Manchu_Events.52.d: "Born as a Ming Prince, Zhu Da, Bada Shanren had to seek refuge when Qing armies invaded. He was unsure of his position in society in the shifting regime, and so waited out the storm in a monastery. Strangely, after leaving the monastery it is reported that he acted strangely and with much eccentricity; many have attributed this acting-out to a mental break from the stress of losing his family. His works in painting exhibit a wet and subdued style which captured the being of plants and animals perfectly, while his landscapes feature short, sharp brush strokes which render the land unlike any of his contemporaries."
 ME_Manchu_Events.52.a: "A misunderstood genius..."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.53.t: "Jiang Tingxi, Encyclopedian"
 ME_Manchu_Events.53.d: "As an official painter of the Qing Court, Jiang Tinxi has become adept in a number of artistic styles, though he specializes in painting birds, flowers, and calligraphic arts. In our efforts to document and compile the known knowledge of the Qing Dynasty, the Emperor has commissioned a great work,'Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times.' Such a work will require many, many illustrations and Jiang Tingxi seems very fit for the job."
 ME_Manchu_Events.53.a: "Well, he is already on the payroll."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.54.t: "Shi Tao, Individualist Painter"
 ME_Manchu_Events.54.d: "The works of Shi Tao have been making waves amongst artists. He leads a movement known as Individualism - a movement which forgoes rigidly codified artistic techniques. His works themselves contained bold, impressionistic, brush strokes and an interest in subjective perspective. The accompanying poetry and calligraphy are similarly irreverent and artful."
 ME_Manchu_Events.54.a: "This new style is fantastic."
 ME_Manchu_Events.54.b: "I'm not quite a fan."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.55.t: "Fuqing, Resident to Tibet"
 ME_Manchu_Events.55.d: "As a former general of the Qing army, Fuqing had recieved much experience in leadership. It was for this reason that he appeared to the Emperor as someone fit to keep the peace in the tumultuous region of Tibet."
 ME_Manchu_Events.55.a: "He seems quite competent."
 ME_Manchu_Events.55.a: "Probably best to keep generals as generals."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.56.t: "Huang Shujing, First Imperial High Commissioner to Taiwan"
 ME_Manchu_Events.56.d: "Huang Shujing was a native to Beijing, sent to Taiwan by the Emperor to oversea its administration. He recorded the findings in 'Records from the Mission to Taiwan and its Strait.' Perhaps we should recall him, and have him serve the emperor closer to home, where his newfound experience can be utilized?"
 ME_Manchu_Events.56.a: "Yes, it would be a good idea."
 ME_Manchu_Events.56.b: "He already seems quite competent in Taiwan."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.57.t: "Keying, Negotiator to the West"
 ME_Manchu_Events.57.d: "Keying was a Manchu bannerman, born to the House of Aisin Giroro, and of the Plan Blue Banner. He served as a statesman with high competency, before being evicted from his position due to corruption."
 ME_Manchu_Events.57.a: "We could use his skills again in the Court. Find him!"
 ME_Manchu_Events.57.a: "Put his skills to use as a diplomat instead."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.58.t: "Songgotu, Minister and Duke"
 ME_Manchu_Events.58.d: "During the rising of the Emperor [Root.Monarch.GetName], Songgotu helped the young Emperor depose the regent. His loyalty and skills allowed him to rise through the ranks, gaining many prominent positions. His position as one of the most influential statesmen of the Imperial Court was exhibited when he acted as diplomat to Russia and signed the Treaty of Nerchinsk."
 ME_Manchu_Events.58.a: "Continue serving at the Emperor's Side."
 ME_Manchu_Events.58.b: "Have him negotiate with other foreign powers."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.59.t: "Tulisen, Embassy to the Kalmyks"
 ME_Manchu_Events.59.d: "Originally a mid-level statesman in the Qing Bureaucracy, Tulisen made himself known to the greater world after he was appointed by the Qing embassy to the Kalmyk Khan. His journeys through Siberia and the Russian Empire captured the interest of both China and Western Powers. After the publishing of his travelouge, he returned to Beijing where he headed more negotiations with Russia. "
 ME_Manchu_Events.59.a: "It's time for him to serve in China."
 ME_Manchu_Events.59.b: "His diplomatic missions are fascinating."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.60.t: "Yang Fang, Writer and General"
 ME_Manchu_Events.60.d: "A Chinese general who trained in military school at the recommendation of Yang Yuchun, Yang Fang gained recognition in suppressing revolts; his exploits reached past the Chinese homeland, when he continued to maintain order in Xinjiang. He later served as a diplomat to contravening Western powers, taking a hardline stance against their meddling."
 ME_Manchu_Events.60.a: "I like a diplomat who can stand his ground!"
 ME_Manchu_Events.60.b: "Perhaps he should stay a man of the army."
 ME_Manchu_Events.60.c: "Have him lead the military bureaucracy."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.61.t: "Thomas Pereira"
 ME_Manchu_Events.61.d: "Thomas Pereira was a Jesuit Missionary from Portugal. He stayed came to China to study at a Western-established university in the fields of science and mathematics, but eventually landed a position in the Qing Imperial Court for the remainder of his life. Among his accomplishments are helping neogitate the Treaty of Nerchinsk and managing the Imperial Observatory in the place of the offical director, who was not in China for a time."
 ME_Manchu_Events.61.a: "Place him amongst the diplomatic corps."
 ME_Manchu_Events.61.b: "A man with these talents shall not go wasted."

 ME_Manchu_Events.62.t: "Johann Schreck"
 ME_Manchu_Events.62.d: "Schreck studied in institutions throughout Europe, becoming a highly respected academic in medicine and eventually joining the Accademia dei Lincei, an Italian science acadmey. It was during this time in the Academy at Rome that he decided to join the Jesuit order, and recruited by a fellow missionary to conduct a mission to China. The mission was to share the most advanced scientific knowledge with the Chinese; Schreck arrived in China in 1619. He spent some time learning Chinese before travelling to Beijing. There, he incidentally entered in competition to predict the upcoming solar eclipse. The accuracy of his prediciton surpassed the native Chinese astronomers' predictions."
 ME_Manchu_Events.62.a: "Have him revise the Calendar."
 ME_Manchu_Events.62.b: "We need a man of medicine."

 ME_Manchu_Events.63.t: "Minggatu"
 ME_Manchu_Events.63.d: "Born Sharvyn Myangat to the Plain White Banner, Minggatu found his place at the Imperial Observatory, in a time when Jesuit Missionaries were the primary directors. He worked there for over three decades, where he compiled and edited three significant astronomical texts. Beyond that, he is also an accomplished mathematician, becoming the first person in China to calculate infinite series and obtain more than then formula, as well as first in the world to invent what would be known as Catalan Numbers."
 ME_Manchu_Events.63.a: "Ah, yes, of course... Catalan Numbers."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.64.t: "Ye Tianshi"
 ME_Manchu_Events.64.d: "The advancements made by the Han scholar, Ye Tianshi are making their rounds in the medival community. His theories on 'warm diseases' characterize the nature and treatment of feverish ailments."
 ME_Manchu_Events.64.a: "Someone to heal me while i'm sick!"
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.65.t: "Beginning of the High Qing Era"
 ME_Manchu_Events.65.d: "From the wild lands of Manchuria descended a great Khan who fought the armies of the Ming, captured city after city, and usurped the title of the Emperor of China and became the Son of Heaven. From him a great empire rose - the Empire of China of the Qing Dynasty.\nFinally, during the reign of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is the former power and wealth of China restored. The steppe nomads have been pacified, the mountains of Tibet subjugated, the wastelands of Siberia secured, and all fronts have been brought to peace.\nInnovation and arts may now flourish, the people are now settling, and the granaries will overflow with bounty."
 ME_Manchu_Events.65.a: "A new Era has arrived."
 qng_regnal_titles: "From now on, new rulers may select an Era Name."
 
 ME_Manchu_Events.66.t: "Emperor [Root.Monarch.GetName] Announces the New Era"
 ME_Manchu_Events.66.d: "The Era Name is a Chinese custom which reaches back to the times of Ancient China. Functionally, it serves as the regnal year, a dating system based on the ruler of the time. There is more to an Era Name than it's simple function, though. Each Era Name has a literary meaning - perhaps one meant to reflect the politcal landscape or to characterize the events of the era. In the past, it was not uncommon to choose multiple Era Names in the span of one Emperor's liftime, but, since the time of the Ming, it has become the custom to only use one. \n\nWhile the passing of each Emperor is always a sad affair, the succession of the new Emperor is also always an auspicious affair.\n\nAfter a short time on the throne Emperor [Root.Monarch.GetName] has has made his decision of the new Era Name. It will be..."

We refer to this corpus once again to learn from our predecessor's procedure on sacrificial rites. We have no uniform practice on how to go about annual practices. The Ming Huidian recommends to do all annual sacrifices simultaneously, as opposed to our current practice of separately."
