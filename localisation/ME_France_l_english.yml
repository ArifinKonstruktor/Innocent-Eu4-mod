 fra_centralization_desc: "As the case was with Tax Collectors before the Bureaucratic Reforms, so it was with local Nobles and Lords.

However, towards the end of the 15th and the beginning of the 16th century, this began to change. Regular troops overtook the amount of mercenaries and the once-powerful lords were relegated to local duties only, leaving the French Army to be commanded by and serve, the King."
 fra_the_huguenots_desc: "Once a prominent minority that later grew in numbers, the Huguenots were considered at best vocal heretics by the local religious authorities. With the rise of Protestants and Reformed followers, the Huguenots saw their chance of gaining representation and urged the peasantry and common folk to take up arms against the oppression of the Catholics which led to widespread bloodbath and massacre of Huguenot populations all across Paris."
 fra_triple_henry_desc: "A long feud in a series of civil wars in France known as the French Wars of Religion, the armed conflicts between believers of different faiths was later dubbed "War of the Three Henrys" as a reference to the men mostly responsible for the slaughter that occurred during these unstable times."
 fra_renaissance_ideas_desc: "Prosperous people are more akin to spend time in scientific and academic pursuits. Such is the case in late 15th century France, where the quality of life as well as tolerance reached new heights, enabling scholars and men of science to bring forth new groundbreaking research."
 fra_modernized_bureaucracy_desc: "New Administrative advances and reforms in the Bureaucratic sector have enabled us to greatly increase the efficiency of our various Government systems. Truly France is entering an Era of streamlined, efficient bureaucracy and meritocratic allocation of government seats."
 fra_mousson_title: "Pont-à-Mousson"
 fra_mousson_desc: "Lorraine was always an important province during the Late Middle Ages. Once France entered the 16th century, it became even more grand, becoming the home city of a wonderful University as well as a brand new set of fortifications, walls, effectively turning the town into a flourishing Citadel"
 fra_uni_nantes_title: "University of Nantes"
 fra_uni_nantes_desc: "Following the annexation of the important Brittany Peninsula, the French King parted ways with a large sum of money, in order to redesign the whole city, bring new life through booming marketplaces as well as construct the Grand University of Nantes that would eventually be open to even the common folk."
 fra_uni_aix_title: "Aix-en-Provence"
 fra_uni_aix_desc: "Education in Early Modern France was a luxury up until the late 15th century, once France stabilized and was well underway. The Provencal University was formally founded in the early 15th century, opening to the local nobility. Later, it became a beacon of scientific progress after undergoing a major expansion under French hold."
 fra_uni_avignon_title: "University of Avignon"
 fra_uni_avignon_desc: "Founded under Pope Boniface VIII, the university attracted a great deal of foreigner influx, eager to enlighten themselves, leaving good coin in exchange. When Avignon became a part of France, the University continued operating, however altering the teaching and the curriculum originally made by the Pope himself."
 fra_uni_paris_title: "Université de Paris"
 fra_uni_paris_desc: "A university older than time itself. Its libraries filled with all manner of dusty and rare manuscripts. The premises of this age-old establishment have been battered by centuries of knowledge and have withered to an alarming degree. It is about time we massively renovate the University and restore it to its former glory."
