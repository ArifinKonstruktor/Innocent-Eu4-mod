At that time the city was fortified and equipped with two ports. In the mid-fifteenth century the Communitas Ragusina began to be called Respublica Ragusina. In the same years, also the federated city of Ragusa, Ancona, passed from the denomination Comunitas Anconae to that of Respublica Anconitana."

Also for this reason this vital connection and the set of problems that arose in this period in the Dalmatian area cannot fail to be at the center of our attention, especially since through their analysis the profile of the Venetian attitude towards all the Adriatic areas."

To avoid succumbing to Venetian rule, these two republics made multiple lasting alliances. \n\nVenice conquered Ragusa in 1205 and held it until 1382 when Ragusa regained de facto freedom, paying tributes first to the Hungarians, and after the Battle of Mohács, to the Ottoman Empire. During this period Ragusa reconfirmed its old alliance with Ancona."
