 # Events:
 ME_England_Events.1.t: "Maine Reclaimed"
 ME_England_Events.1.d: "Ever since the French have captured the city, the English Loyalists have stayed in hiding to avoid persecution by the French. However, on this blessed day, the aforementioned men are able to go out of hiding and finally be free to express their loyalty to us. The mentioned men formed a mob that is currently welcoming our forces into the city of Maine. Lots of the men want to commit to the war effort and boost our dwindling manpower reserves."
 ME_England_Events.1.a: "Forward, to glory!"
 
 ME_England_Events.2.t: "The Second Treaty of Tours"
 ME_England_Events.2.d: "At last, we are victorious. The war that lasted a hundred years is finally over. Alas, many have lost their lives, both civilians and soldiers. Villages were burned, cities were sacked, lands of France - devastated. But now, the war is finally over. Order has been restored to the French Lands, a new order. The French Kingdom lies at our mercy. It is time for the second Treaty of Tours."
 ME_England_Events.2.a: "We must focus on the continental affairs."
 ME_England_Events.2.b: "This kingdom will make a fine addition to my collection."
 
 ME_England_Events.3.t: "Jack Cade's Rebellion"
 ME_England_Events.3.d: "Angered by the events of the Hundred Years' War and the taxes that came with it, peasants have risen up in a rebellion against the government as we could not cope with their demands. The rebels claim that the current regime is corrupt and the king's court is abusing its powers. Inspired by previous rebellions, the peasantry of Sussex and Kent have risen up in a revolt against the government and are now on the march to seize London."
 ME_England_Events.3.a: "Damn Them!"
 
 ME_England_Events.4.t: "Book of Common Prayer"
 ME_England_Events.4.d: "To aid in clerical influence over the commonfolk, [Root.Monarch.GetName] and his council of advisors have come up with the novel idea to introduce a special compendium of ceremonies and prayer that would help to induce religious unity across the nation's innumerable churches. In all English lands, the 'Book of Common Prayer' is to be as the standard of faith and ceremony, effectively pairing with the dissolution of monasteries to assert religious unity and control over the people. One question remains as to the nature of this introduction: to what degree shall we rush to spread this compendium?"
 ME_England_Events.4.a: "Gradual introduction will serve us best"
 ME_England_Events.4.b: "The faster, the better!"
 
 ME_England_Events.5.t: "Pilgrimage of Grace"
 ME_England_Events.5.d: "With the consolidation of religious matters in the hands of the state, the nation has entered a hopefully temporary state of turmoil akin to chaos. With the dissolution of monasteries and other religious developments, our state finds itself met with pure iconoclastic rage, enough to inspire fear in the brave man's soul. The trumpets of rebellion sing their jaunty tune; the people of the north call for revolt. Their Pilgrimage is upon us."
 ME_England_Events.5.a: "Fools!"
 
 ME_England_Events.7.t: "Statutes of Iona"
 ME_England_Events.7.d: "With the establishment of state-funded schools in the Lowlands and our glorious conquest of the northern clans, we are now left with unruly clans that still resist our laws and try to govern themselves. The so-designated 'Statutes of Iona' are to end this cultural war and to bring the Highlander cultures closer to the much more English-like Lowlander Scottish."
 ME_England_Events.7.a: "Adopt the Statutes"
 ME_England_Events.7.b: "The clans should be left alone"
 
 ME_England_Events.9.t: "Work of William Caxton"
 ME_England_Events.9.d: "William Caxton was skilled blah blah"
 ME_England_Events.9.a: "Splendid!"
 
 ME_England_Events.10.t: "The Icy Grip of Death"
 ME_England_Events.10.d: "The once merry tune of church bells seems to fade unto the grey morning mist. At a time a source of joy, they call forth the open casket of our dear [Root.Monarch.GetName], pride and joy to all who served beneath him. As the bells slow, an eerie tune begins to sound throughout [Root.Capital.GetName]. Our former [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s body moves slowly through the city, without motion and without an heir to bequeath the throne. The [Root.GovernmentName] lay in ruin, and the succession remains untaken. There is but one person to seize our throne now. King of the Scots, [SCO.Monarch.GetName] was a distant to [Root.Monarch.GetName] and thus is the only seemingly legitimate heir to our lands."
 ME_England_Events.10.a: "Our relative in Scotland shall proceed to rule [Root.GetName]"
 ME_England_Events.10.b: "Let us appoint a local noble instead."
 
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.1.t: "Trade Company Conflict"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.1.d: "Several prominent trade companies have engaged in a skirmish regarding the rights to a certain naval passage. Though the true possessor of these rights is clear, granting them to the opposing side is not an idea without merit."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.1.a: "Support the righteous one."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.1.b: "Accept the bribe from the other side."
 
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.2.t: "New Company Created"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.2.d: "A new trade company has emerged, but not without opposition. The burgher coalition has no quarrels with its foundation, but detests any words of granting it a monopoly."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.2.a: "Give them Royal Charter."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.2.b: "They should not have a monopoly."
 
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.3.t: "Mercantile Plans"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.3.d: "Several members of a prominent burgher family have approached us with plans for a new trade company. Should we accept, we grant a royal monopoly in return for a considerable portion of the proceedings."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.3.a: "Fund them."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.3.b: "We cannot afford to spend the royal ducats."
 
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.4.t: "Mercantile Plot"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.4.d: "A plot involving several important seats of Parliament taking bribes has come to light. The gilded corruptor in question happens to be a prominent trading company, soiling governance for their own gain."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.4.a: "With Sin comes punishment."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.4.b: "We shan't oppose their actions."
 
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.5.t: "Company in Ruin"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.5.d: "A major trade company, through abhorrant spending practices, has gone bankrupt and is in the process of defaulting on their loans. Such proceedings would greatly damage regional trade."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.5.a: "Save them."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.5.b: "They have naught to blame but themselves."
 
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.6.t: "Company Stock"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.6.d: "Rumor has it that a major company's stocks may be on the rise. Though we have no confirmation, if this is true, not investing would be a grave error."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.6.a: "We would rather invest and regret than the converse."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.6.b: "Such risks are beneath us."
 
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.7.t: "Colonial Conflict"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.7.d: "A conflict has arisen regarding rights to a certain valuable plot of land. The clergy claim it as their own, and have already begun constructing a church at the location. However, we seem to have granted the same land to a nearby trade company for an outpost. The two factions cannot coincide; how shall we proceed?"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.7.a: "Allow construction of the outpost."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.7.b: "Cede the land to the church."
 
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.8.t: "Trade Companies Demand Rights"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.8.d: "Several prominent trade companies of the nation have grown discontented despite their existing charters. They demand additional monopolies, and are prepared to back up their demands with steel."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.8.a: "Humour their petty demands."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.8.b: "Their complaining is of no consequence."
 
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.9.t: "Rival Nation"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.9.d: "Our trade companies face steep resistance, and royal charters only go so far. In the face of foreign competition, our merchants have not been faring particularly well. Shall we step up to the challenge?"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.9.a: "Mercantilism first!"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.9.b: "We shan't anger the powers that be."
 
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.10.t: "Stock Crash"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.10.d: "Perhaps hindsight is useless, but we really should have seen this coming. Ever since the establishment of the stock market, nobles and burghers alike have speculated heavily on upward trends, consequences be damned. The market is now in a downward spiral, with only future plummits in sight.
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.10.a: "Save the market!"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.10.b: "Let it sort itself out."
 
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.11.t: "Rise of the Trade Companies"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.11.d: "Not all done in the name of profits ends well. All investments involve risk, and in this case, the risk of economic collapse has become all too real. Several important trade companies have risen to power, going beyond their charter and exerting economic influence on the motherland. We may be too late to stop the chaos."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.11.a: "Worrisome."
 
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.12.t: "Trade Companies Losing Influence"
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.12.d: "Just as the economy has booms and recessions, so too do the trade companies that exert considerable influence upon it. Through some abhorrent spending practices, the trade companies have been forced to rescind their new influence and return to the confines of their charters."
 ME_Trade_Company_Events.12.a: "Marvelous!"
