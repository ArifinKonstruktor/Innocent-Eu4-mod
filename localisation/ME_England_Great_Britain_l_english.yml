 # Events:
 ME_England_Events.1.t: "Maine Reclaimed"
 ME_England_Events.1.d: "Ever since the French have captured the city, the English Loyalists have stayed in hiding to avoid persecution by the French. However, on this blessed day, the aforementioned men are able to go out of hiding and finally be free to express their loyalty to us. The mentioned men formed a mob that is currently welcoming our forces into the city of Maine. Lots of the men want to commit to the war effort and boost our dwindling manpower reserves."
 ME_England_Events.1.a: "Forward, to glory!"
 
 ME_England_Events.2.t: "The Second Treaty of Tours"
 ME_England_Events.2.d: "At last, we are victorious. The war that lasted a hundred years is finally over. Alas, many have lost their lives, both civilians and soldiers. Villages were burned, cities were sacked, lands of France - devastated. But now, the war is finally over. Order has been restored to the French Lands, a new order. The French Kingdom lies at our mercy. It is time for the second Treaty of Tours."
 ME_England_Events.2.a: "We must focus on the continental affairs."
 ME_England_Events.2.b: "This kingdom will make a fine addition to my collection."
