In our wine shop you will find the best Moscato wines, from the Alto Adige Yellow and Rosa to the Pantelleria version, where this vine is called Zibibbo. The name of this wine probably derives from the characteristics of the Muscat grape, which recalls musk and nutmeg: on the nose, in addition to these notes, peach, sage and honey can also be recognized, and on the palate these notes return and is distinguished by its great lightness and drinkability.  Widespread throughout Italy, Moscato is mainly used in Piedmont, in the Moscato Bianco variety."

 ME_Montferrat_Events.1.T: "Greek Knowledge"
 ME_Montferrat_Events.1.D: "I myself listened to him in Florence, since he came to the Council together with the Greeks, affirming that the whole world, after a few years, would adhere to one and the same religion, with one soul, one mind, one teaching. And when I asked him: 'That of Christ or of Muhammad'? He replied: 'Neither, but one not different from that of the Gentiles'. I was so scandalized by these words that I always hated him and always feared him like a poisonous viper, and I could no longer bear to see him or hear him. I also learned from some Greeks, who fled the Peloponnese here, that he had publicly stated, some three years before his death, that - not many years after his death - Muhammad and Christ would be forgotten and the actual truth would triumph in every part of the world."

Darkness then descends day turns into night, a massive cloud of thousand arrows fills the misty sky. \n\nWith violent force the two armies crash the battle now begins, cries of war as weapons clash, uncertain who will win. \n\nThunder rolls 'cross the waves, lightning cracks the sky, clouds release hail big as grapes, as arrows are let fly. \n\nHear the soldiers' roar! they call to mighty Lord, the fury in their raging eyes, will burn forever more. Hear the weapons sing! Feel the arrows sting! They climb onto the Capital's walls and begin to fight."

I've spent my life in foolish quests for gold and riches, I confess, and now I'm left with just regrets too late to change my ways. My life, it seems, has slipped away I leave no legacy to praise, nothing more for me to say my life has been a waste."
