 # Generic Franconian Missions:
 FKN_build_an_army_title: "Build an Army"
 FKN_build_an_army_desc: "Our aim is to achieve the unification of the duchies and bishoprics making up Franconia. Building up an army would help maintain our borders and expand into new lands. The future of Franconia depends on our willingness to take action, and therefore we must make sure we have enough forcess to do so!"
 FKN_conquer_nuremburg_title: "Keine Freien Städte Mehr"
 FKN_conquer_nuremburg_desc: "The city-state of Nuremburg is well defended; a great fortress makes up the exterior of the city itself. To control it will be a difficult task, that is no trick. Still, with proper execution of newly developed siege techniques, the walls of Nuremburg can be overcome, and we can use the vast fortress for our own purposes!"
 FKN_conquer_wurzburg_title: "Ecclesiastical Control"
 FKN_conquer_wurzburg_desc: "The Bishoprics of Wurzburg and Bamberg claim to be protected by God, but God alone will not save them from us. Their influence in Franconian politics is too big to go unchecked, so we have to make sure they are out of the picture before they become diplomatically dominant over the region."
 FKN_conquer_ansbach_title: "Subjugate the Margraves"
 FKN_conquer_ansbach_desc: "The House of Hohenzollern rules the quaint Duchy of Ansbach, and as such they have dynastic ties to Brandenburg, a far greater power than us. Their state is set to be under union with Brandenburg once their ruler dies, and so if we don't act fast we'll have to deal with a union. For the continued autonomy of Franconia, Ansbach must be eliminated."
 FKN_unifying_franconia_title: "Unifying Franconia"
 FKN_unifying_franconia_desc: "The time has finally come to unite the old Franconian Duchy of Charlemagne once again. The unification process has taken a toll on our men, our lands, our culture, and maybe even our faith. We have faced many foes, from the Austrians and Bavarians, to the Swabians and Westphalians. So with all the hardships overcome by our will, we can finally say Three Hurrahs for Franconia!"
 FKN_dux_francorum_title: "Dux Francorum"
 FKN_dux_francorum_desc: "For years, the Franconian people have been divided within the petty duchies of the Holy Roman Empire, and have started to lose their morale for a united Franconia. No longer shall our people be separated, and we can only enforce this by uniting the Franconian lands."
