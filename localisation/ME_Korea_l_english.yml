 ME_Korea_Events.7.t: "Sejo's Coup"
 ME_Korea_Events.7.d: "The ascension of the young and inexperienced [Root.Monarch.GetName] to the throne has left two players in the court. The old and skilled regents who uphold the promises made with former king, represented by Hwangbo In and Kim Jongseo, were the last defence for the legitimate successor [Root.Monarch.GetName]. They would help young king's affairs until he could stand on his own two feet. This resulted in tension between the court and royal family members. One of the greatly angered was Sejo, one of the members of the royal family, who, determined to kick those two out of power, has decided to forge a web of alliance and conduct a coup to seize the throne for himself. Soon after his ascension to the throne, he disbanded the Hall of Worthies. His literati supporters became the Hungu faction."

Using the king’s might, he conscripted the pretty girls from all over the country. In exchange, they and their families were given many favors, such as tax exemptions.
