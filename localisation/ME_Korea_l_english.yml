 ME_Korea_Events.7.t: "Sejo's Coup"
 ME_Korea_Events.7.d: "The ascension of the young and inexperienced [Root.Monarch.GetName] to the throne has left two players in the court. The old and skilled regents who uphold the promises made with former king, represented by Hwangbo In and Kim Jongseo, were the last defence for the legitimate successor [Root.Monarch.GetName]. They would help young king's affairs until he could stand on his own two feet. This resulted in tension between the court and royal family members. One of the greatly angered was Sejo, one of the members of the royal family, who, determined to kick those two out of power, has decided to forge a web of alliance and conduct a coup to seize the throne for himself. Soon after his ascension to the throne, he disbanded the Hall of Worthies. His literati supporters became the Hungu faction."
 ME_Korea_Events.7.a: "And so it begins..."

 ME_Korea_Events.8.t: "A New Era"
 ME_Korea_Events.8.d: "The death of the king has shaken everyone in the court. The previous faction trembles in fear of being rejected by the new ruler and tried for their misdeeds. Who will the new ruler support though?"
 ME_Korea_Events.8.a: "Hungu, the Contributed Bureaucrats"
 ME_Korea_Events.8.b: "Sarim, the Straight Scholars"
 ME_Korea_Events.8.c: "East, the Loyal Absolutists"
 ME_Korea_Events.8.e: "West, the Aristocratic Idealists"

 ME_Korea_Events.9.t: "The Changing Times"
 ME_Korea_Events.9.d: "Due to internal strife amongst the faction members, the Sarim factions has split into two. Those who favor the absolute government call themselves the east and the aristocratic idealists call themselves the west. Their debates dominate the topic of everyday conversations and are in mouth of every scholar. In such environment, the Hungu factions fades to obscurity paving the way for a new factional split. The era of East versus the West has begun."
 ME_Korea_Events.9.a: "Support the West"
 ME_Korea_Events.9.b: "Support the East"

 ME_Korea_Events.11.t: "New Reforms"
 ME_Korea_Events.11.d: "The ruling faction has suggested a bunch of reforms aiming to implement their agenda. After further examination, the changes have been deemed an absolute positive and implemented."
 ME_Korea_Events.11.a: "Fantastic News!"

 ME_Korea_Events.12.t: "Diminishing Authority"
 ME_Korea_Events.12.d: "The reforms suggested by the current faction are threatening the authority of the royalty. Such reforms would be not only controversial, but also harmful to us. However, they would also improve the status of the country. Shall we proceed?"
 ME_Korea_Events.12.a: "Proceed with the reforms"
 ME_Korea_Events.12.b: "Veto! Authority is key."

 ME_Korea_Events.13.t: "Radical Reforms"
 ME_Korea_Events.13.d: "Ruling faction, although acting for the greater good, is aiming to implement reforms of such radicality, that they would greatly destabilize our country. Surely, implementing the reforms would be beneficial, but is it worth the cost?"
 ME_Korea_Events.13.a: "Let us Proceed."
 ME_Korea_Events.13.b: "To destabilize the country is to ruin it from within. No reforms!"

 ME_Korea_Events.14.t: "Military Opposition"
 ME_Korea_Events.14.d: "The benevolent reforms proposed by the scholars of the current faction are striving towards improving the state of the country. However, these reforms indirectly conflict with the interests of our General Staff. Should we implement the reforms, a large portion of officers will resign."
 ME_Korea_Events.14.a: "Clearly, the generals are not fit for their job anyway"
 ME_Korea_Events.14.b: "We need them!"

 ME_Korea_Events.15.t: "Reforms threaten General Staff"
 ME_Korea_Events.15.d: "Unfortunately, the new reforms, despite being innovative in nature, are putting a strain on our research. If implemented, they will jeopardize our research until it stabilizes few years after."
 ME_Korea_Events.15.a: "Reforms lead to progress!"
 ME_Korea_Events.15.b: "We can't afford this, even if short term."

 ME_Korea_Events.16.t: "Reforms alter Hyang'yak"
 ME_Korea_Events.16.d: "The Hyang'yak allows for a degree of local governments. The autonomy of Hyang'yak has allowed the agrarian economy to flourish and the local governments to administer properly. Unfortunately, the new reforms being implemented by the factions would impede that delicate balance."
 ME_Korea_Events.16.a: "No progress without struggle."
 ME_Korea_Events.16.b: "The Hyangyak is sacred!"

 ME_Korea_Events.17.t: "A Great Philosopher"
 ME_Korea_Events.17.d: "Once in a while, a great philosopher is born. If the talent is properly assessed and the philosopher starts making breakthroughs, he is carefully examined and praised for his work. Once one's fame grows large enough, the King would grant his own signature to the regional Seowon. It was a great honor to gain such signature, and as such it is notoriously used for bragging. Now, with one of the praised philosophers gaining tractions, what should be done?"
 ME_Korea_Events.17.a: "Grant Glorious Name!"
 ME_Korea_Events.17.b: "No special favors!"
 
 ME_Korea_Events.18.t: "Left Right Unite"
 ME_Korea_Events.18.d: "The Factions, notorious for constantly being at odds with each other, are not all that bad as the word of mouth makes it out to be. Factions, albeit hostile to each other, are ready to unite for the greater good. We are blessed to witness such unity happen right before our eyes, as the factions are united and passing an urgent reform!"
 ME_Korea_Events.18.a: "At least they could agree for once!"

 ME_Korea_Events.19.t: "A Nobi Scholar"
 ME_Korea_Events.19.d: "The ever-growing academy of Syeongkyunkwan has begun to lack servants that would serve there. As such, there has been a spike in Nobi servants, which would begin to read and write as a result of the spike in private education. Among those, one bright would begin to aim for the stars. That nobi would come to study and master the knowledge of confucianism and would begin to teach the students on his own."
 ME_Korea_Events.19.a: "An example to follow"
 ME_Korea_Events.19.b: "A Nobi he is, a scholar he cannot be"

 ME_Korea_Events.20.t: "Axe Appeal"
 ME_Korea_Events.20.d: "In the constant stream of issues that reach King everyday, it is difficult for one to hear out everybody's opinion and make well-weighted decisions at the same time. But sometimes, some scholars are desparate enough to have their opinions heard, so they have the audacity to do the Jibusangso, the axe appeal. Having placed an axe besides them, the scholar cries out for the king to hear out his opinions or to cut his head off."
 ME_Korea_Events.20.a: "Satisfy him."
 ME_Korea_Events.20.b: "Much unnecessary drama for petty reasons!"
 ME_Korea_Events.20.c: "He wants his head cut off?"

 ME_Korea_Events.21.t: "Mass Appeal"
 ME_Korea_Events.21.d: "It is approaching evening as you go out of your palace after a long discussion with your literatis on the current state of affairs within the nation. You end the meeting, thank everyone for coming, open the door, and once you cross the threshold, you are greeted by a dozen or so literatis, all on their knees before you. Suddenly, one of them, most likely their leader, raises his head and murmurs 'Your Majesty, please reconsider.' Once he has said his line, the crowd reiterates the statement indefinitely."
 ME_Korea_Events.21.a: "I will reconsider, just cease!"
 ME_Korea_Events.21.b: "Stand up, you are making this very awkward."

 ME_Korea_Events.22.t: "University Strike"
 ME_Korea_Events.22.d: "It is heavenly duty of students to pursue knowledge. However, even the most vigorous pupils are ready to disregard that, should they believe they are acting for the greater good. As such, the overwhelming majority of students of Syeongkyunkwan has decided to band together and refused to participate in lectures, so as to come and protest the recent changes mandated by [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 ME_Korea_Events.22.a: "Well, they do have a point..."
 ME_Korea_Events.22.b: "They clearly haven't been taught enough!"

 ME_Korea_Events.23.t: "Intrigue in the Court"
 ME_Korea_Events.23.d: "Rumors be, that there is a conspiracy brewing against the King. Of course, to conspire against the King is an action of extreme risk, so it is unlikely that the rumors are indeed true. However, should they be true, the royal authority is in real danger. Must action be taken in accordance to dealing with the gossips?"
 ME_Korea_Events.23.a: "Purge the Rot!"
 ME_Korea_Events.23.b: "It's all just saying."

 ME_Korea_Events.24.t: "Reforms bring Prosperity"
 ME_Korea_Events.24.d: "Proper management of the economy and the invaluable input of the factions has lead to reforms, that make the kingdom prosper like never before."
 ME_Korea_Events.24.a: "What a time to be alive!"

 ME_Korea_Events.25.t: "An entertaining Debate"
 ME_Korea_Events.25.d: "The scholarly environment the confucianist culture brings us has lead to a grand debate among the scholars of rivalry factions. The debate has lasted for much of the day and has had many fascinating points brought up. The opposing side always gave shrewd responses and lead to logical conclusions. To say that it has influenced the King is an understatement."
 ME_Korea_Events.25.a: "Fascinating!"

 ME_Korea_Events.26.t: "Hostility between Factions Growing"
 ME_Korea_Events.26.d: "The Factions, infamous for their constant conflicts, are at it again. The past few days have been of high tension within the royal palace. Some of the literatis have been discovered bringing bladed weaponry into the debates. While these cases happen from time to time, the spike in discoveries is a bad omen."
 ME_Korea_Events.26.a: "Try to mend the situation!"

 ME_Korea_Events.27.t: "Split in the faction"
 ME_Korea_Events.27.d: "It is only natural, that factions undergo changes with time. As such, as a result of one of the debates held within the ruling faction, two sides emerged, one supporting the conservative approach, the latter, more radical, supporting new policies that would alter many ideals. The split has greatly weakened the faction and [Root.Monarch.GetName] needs to support one of the sides."
 ME_Korea_Events.27.a: "It's the nature of time, that the old ways must give in."
 ME_Korea_Events.27.b: "The Tradition must be upheld!"

 ME_Korea_Events.28.t: "Palace Expansion"
 ME_Korea_Events.28.d: "The royal palace is visual representation of the royal power. The more grander it gets, the more authority the king seems to have. [Root.Monarch.GetName], keep in mind, the palace is already great enough. It needs not be expanded, only forbidden palace is larger than it! Compulsory expansion will cost valuable funds, that could be used in funding the military instead. Maybe the tax could be lowered to appease the commons?"
 ME_Korea_Events.28.a: "It shall be more glorious than ever!"
 ME_Korea_Events.28.b: "Maybe you're right."

 ME_Korea_Events.29.t: "Gumgye Crisis"
 ME_Korea_Events.29.d: "Marginalization and inability to succeed in life has for centuries been bringing people to the criminal ways. As such, a violent organization called 'Gumgye' has sprung up, spreading organized crime across the country. They have been terrorizing the country for the longest times. However, the secret service says that the some of the bureaucrats are paying them to attack the opposing faction. That explains the recent unsolved crimes. The evidence is substantial, and it is enough to persecute the corrupt court."
 ME_Korea_Events.29.a: "The crimes are unsolved, okay?"
 ME_Korea_Events.29.b: "Rot shall be purged."

 ME_Korea_Events.30.t: "Jobo Leak"
 ME_Korea_Events.30.d: "Jobo is the governmental press that carries news of the state. Seldom it even has confidential information, not to be shared with anybody unauthorized. Few days past, a diplomat came into the court to discuss a new trade quota. After some time and some carousing, the diplomat spilled our recent military information while drunk. It is clear that they shouldn't have known about such information. As such, you gather up all the people capable of leaking the plans. One of the new bureaucrats stands up and accuses his superior of leaking it. They belong to different factions, however the freshman claims he has strong evidence for it."
 ME_Korea_Events.30.a: "Lead an in-depth investigation"
 ME_Korea_Events.30.b: "I like his claims!"

 ME_Korea_Events.31.t: "Oligopoly of Rice"
 ME_Korea_Events.31.d: "Rice is most definitely the most important crop within all of Asia. Due to the crop's high yield and efficiency, people in the region are supporters of physiocracy. However, playing the wrong game with the crop would lead to a disaster on an unprecedented scale. Being so profitable, many people have been attracted by the possibility of multiplying their wealth. As such, many bureaucrats have gotten involved with an oligopoly of rice in the capital area. Of course, the commons are greatly upset with this state of affairs. What should be done about the oligopoly?"
 ME_Korea_Events.31.a: "Cut down on the Oligopoly"
 ME_Korea_Events.31.b: "Turn a blind eye"

 ME_Korea_Events.32.t: "Heung-Cheong"
 ME_Korea_Events.32.d: "Under the autocratic nature of the king's rule, it was his right to flirt with any girl he wanted to. Furthermore, all monarchs were capable of understanding that going too far in that regard would result in a horrendous scandal. This king, however... this king crossed the line by a mile. Using the king’s might, he conscripted the pretty girls from all over the country. In exchange, they and their families were given many favors, such as tax exemptions. The favors of course... the favors would come to drive the treasury empty. By the way, over 1000 girls? In the palace where Hall of Worthies lied?"
 ME_Korea_Events.32.a: "This is one peculiar king"

 ME_Korea_Events.33.t: "Pledge of Allegiance"
 ME_Korea_Events.33.d: "It is responsibility of a bureaucrat to remonstrate with the king, even if it might cost his life. Bureaucrats' complaints must be heard thoroughly and carefully. This cultural tradition is what Korean Government relies on. Noone would dare to break the harmony of the system until [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Yesterday, the wild, irrational, emotional king has decided to execute one of the ministers, who was administering the internal affairs. Today, you commanded all of the bureaucrats to wear cloth with written 'Absolute' on the front and 'Loyalty' on the back."
 ME_Korea_Events.33.a: "Ministers will stay absolutely loyal for sure."

 ME_Korea_Events.34.t: "Closure of University"
 ME_Korea_Events.34.d: "My majesty, I understand that you are paranoid with the recent strikes and protests directed from the young scholars of Syeongkyunkwan. I also understand and tolerate your decision not to study how to rule the country. I realize you want to go out hunting. But are you really going to close down Syeongkyunkwan, the main educational institution in the capital? Are you really going to make it into your own personal playground? ... Damn it."
 ME_Korea_Events.34.a: "He is clearly wise enough!"

 ME_Korea_Events.35.t: "Nobi Drilling"
 ME_Korea_Events.35.d: "Joseon dynasty has been born as a result of a coup instructed by general Yi Seonggye. To prevent anyone from doing likewise, an effort to institute heavy centralization has been instructed. As such, currently it is forbidden for anyone but King to have armed forces. Law dictates, that people with personal militaries are to be punished for treason. Recently, word has reached you that nobles are training their nobies to arms in the vicinity of the capital. The nobles claim it is to uphold the tradition and to research new military tactics."
 ME_Korea_Events.35.a: "The nobles are not so noble after all..."
 ME_Korea_Events.35.b: "I trust my nobles to the brim!"

 ME_Korea_Events.36.t: "Literati Purge"
 ME_Korea_Events.36.d: "The Bureaucrat responsible for writing down the annals of Joseon Dynasty has put down insults on the ruler's name. The King, discretely observing the new scriptures, has spotted the treason. The King has opted out of scolding the bureaucrat privately or ignoring him, and has instead publicly accused him of blasphemy and killed his faction. Intriguing, as the King is forbidden to look into annals by himself."
 ME_Korea_Events.36.a: "Purge the literatis to avoid rebellion."
 ME_Korea_Events.36.b: "I am the King!"

 ME_Korea_Events.37.t: "Support of Heir"
 ME_Korea_Events.37.d: "It is only natural that with the passing of time and aging of the heir, the support for the heir among the courtiers rises. But this case is different, as never has the Joseon dynasty seen the support for heir that large. It is completely valid to think to think, that there is a conspiracy to replace the [Root.Monarch.GetName] with their heir."
 ME_Korea_Events.37.a: "Purge the faction and isolate my son!"
 ME_Korea_Events.37.b: "This is a good sign!"

 ME_Korea_Events.38.t: "Rebellion!"
 ME_Korea_Events.38.d: "The inaction of [Root.Monarch.GetName] regarding the growing conspiracy has lead to the calamity of a rebellion. The rebels are clear in their intentions, they want to end the rule of the [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 ME_Korea_Events.38.a: "I will show them who is the king!"
 ME_Korea_Events.38.b: "Let us negotiate."
