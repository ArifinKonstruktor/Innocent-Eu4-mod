 ME_Korea_Events.7.t: "Sejo's Coup"
 ME_Korea_Events.7.d: "The ascension of the young and inexperienced [Root.Monarch.GetName] to the throne has left two players in the court. The old and skilled regents who uphold the promises made with former king, represented by Hwangbo In and Kim Jongseo, were the last defence for the legitimate successor [Root.Monarch.GetName]. They would help young king's affairs until he could stand on his own two feet. This resulted in tension between the court and royal family members. One of the greatly angered was Sejo, one of the members of the royal family, who, determined to kick those two out of power, has decided to forge a web of alliance and conduct a coup to seize the throne for himself. Soon after his ascension to the throne, he disbanded the Hall of Worthies. His literati supporters became the Hungu faction."

 ME_Korea_Events.1.t: "The Imperial Capital"
 ME_Korea_Events.1.d: "The New Dynasty has finally unified China, we must decide on where should our capital be, closer to the center of population, or should we keep it in Hanseong and name it the Eastern Capital?"
 ME_Korea_Events.1.a: "Hanseong shall remain the Capital."
 ME_Korea_Events.1.b: "We must move our capital to the center of the Realm."
 ME_Korea_Events.1.c: "Our capital should be in the center of the Chinese Empire."
 ME_Korea_Events.1.e: "What's wrong with our current capital?"
 ME_Korea_Events.2.t: "Gold Discovered in Kaelliponia"
 ME_Korea_Events.2.d: "An accident involving several too many drinks and live explosives seems to have discovered gold in our colony! Though the man in question has perished, an investigation of the accident leads us to believe the rare ore is quite plentiful in the valley! Korea is a land deprived of many natural resources; this occurrence shall correct that grave error."
 ME_Korea_Events.2.a: "This will attract gold miners."
 ME_Korea_Events.3.t: "Gold Rush"
 ME_Korea_Events.3.d: "A wave of temporary settlers has crashed into Kaelliponia, probably due to our recent discovery of gold in the region. Though this will inevitably bring more gold into the country, there are still concerns on how we should tax the miners. On the one hand, high taxes would dissuade miners from embarking to the colony. On the other, we could propagate a higher percentage of the wealth mined."
 ME_Korea_Events.3.a: "No extra taxes!"  #MTTH 60 -80% Goods Produced
 ME_Korea_Events.3.b: "Raise the Taxes!" #MTTH 120 -50% goods produced
 ME_Korea_Events.3.c: "Exploit this as much as you can."  #MTTH 240 -20% goods produced
 ME_Korea_Events.4.t: "Opportunists flock to [Province.GetName]"
 ME_Korea_Events.4.d: "Though the gold rush has settled down quite a bit, the tales of the golden days still bring people to Kaelliponia. Upon realizing the gold is all but gone, they typically settle down for permanent residence. After all, no one wishes to make the trip across the Pacific twice. How should we handle these seemingly permanent settlers?"
 ME_Korea_Events.4.b: "They can take care of themselves."
 ME_Korea_Events.4.a: "Fund them."
 ME_Korea_Events.5.t: "Discontent beyond the Great Wall"
 ME_Korea_Events.5.d: "With the escalation of the conflict between the Heavenly Emperor and the Oirat Horde, the Ming Dynasty finds itself in a difficult position, where it has to endure an invasion of the nomads. With the recent militarization of the country, and our growing ambitions, we should try to leverage the dynasty."
 ME_Korea_Events.5.a: "Lay claims to the North"
 ME_Korea_Events.5.b: "Negotiate a lift of the Seaban"

 # Ideas:
 hostilities_in_the_north: "Hostilities in the North"
 hostilities_in_the_north_desc: "For so long we have faced enemies in the plains to our north. Semi-nomadic or completely nomadic, they are dangerous in every aspect and are only good when securely under our control. Thankfully our connections to the plains people from the past has already given us a benefit in cavalry combat. We won't be fighting them on such unequal terms like we have in the past."
 rally_the_korean_people: "Rally the Korean People"
 rally_the_korean_people_desc: "There is a need for unity amongst the Korean people and for too long they have stood divided on politics or religious matters, what with both the Japanese and Chinese trying to influence the population to their favor. We must strengthen the people, rally them to the Korean banner, and push forth against our foes!"
 against_the_western_foes: "Against the Western Foes"
 against_the_western_foes_desc: "We will learn from the defeats in our past and devise new plans, new tactics, new technologies to mitigate what weaknesses we had. The Chinese may think they are the greatest when it comes to technological innovation, but time and time again they have shown themselves to be weak to foreign influence and invasion. Let us remind them of this fact personally."
