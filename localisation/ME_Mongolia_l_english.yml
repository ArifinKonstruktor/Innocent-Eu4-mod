  kha_timurids_title: "Heartland of the Timurids"
  kha_timurids_desc: "Timur had noble ambitions, but was inevitably too weak to restore what was. Truly, a Mongol Empire can only emerge from Mongolia. We would do well to teach them this."
  kha_uzbek_title: "Conquer Uzbek"
  kha_uzbek_desc: "Following our path of traditional conquest, the Uzbeck nomads lie in our path. They present both a roadblock and a challenge to overcome. They may be united, but so are we."
  kha_nogai_title: "Conquer Nogai"
  kha_nogai_desc: "Nogai, just as with the Uzbek, was traditionally part of our empire and thus must be reintegrated. They present little threat, therefore we may tread lightly."
  kha_mongol_people_title: "Unify the Mongol People"
  kha_mongol_people_desc: "Our century-old rampage left a scattered populace of Mongol peoples with little contact with one another. We even hear stories of a Mongol splinter residing in Anatolia, though we cannot be certain. In the meantime, we should deal with the Great Horde, one of the few legitimate successors to the Golden Horde, which is in turn a legitimate successor to our Grand Empire. All shall be well once more."
  kha_crimea_title: "Attack Crimea"
  kha_crimea_desc: "The Crimeans are another group of Mongol origin. We must continue our reconquests and reintegrate them as well."
  kha_prepare_title: "Prepare for Independence"
  kha_prepare_desc: "A far cry from the Mongol Empire, we have regressed to the point of servitude to our Oirat overlords. The Oirats may have significantly more power than us, but we possess a strength of will akin to that of the Great Khans, and thus we shall inevitably prevail in the upcoming independence struggle. Until then, we must prepare."
  kha_independence_title: "Independence"
  kha_independence_desc: "We have rallied the tribes. Each has contributed a substantial force of cavalry and infantrymen, leading us to believe we are united and prepared for an extended conflict. We need only provoke a conflict."
  kha_past_title: "Overcome the Past"
  kha_past_desc: "We may yet emerge from this downward spiral of national decline and despair, stemming from the calamity of collapse. Strength of will shall surpass strength of arms once more, as it did hundreds of years ago."
  kha_unite_chagatai_title: "Unite the Chagatayids"
  kha_unite_chagatai_desc: "The Chagatai Khanate, though remaining intact, has devolved into numerous squabbling tribes, and thus it is unfit for self-governance. We should reintegrate them into our empire to ensure their survival alongside ours. Strength in numbers and strength in kin."
  kha_yarkand_and_yogir_title: "Yarkand and Yogir"
  kha_yarkand_and_yogir_desc: "Though we despise betrayal, we hold survival in high regard. Upon the collapse of the Empire, several groups fled the nation, relegating themselves unto a fate either within foreign borders or creating a newfound sense of independence. Nevertheless, now that our turmoil is at its end, we should reintegrate these groups."
  kha_yuan_title: "Return of the Yuan"
  kha_yuan_desc: "The Great Khanate, also known as the Yuan Dynasty, recently fell to the Neo-Confuscianist Ming Dynasty, which scorched their own history by removing any sense of Mongol culture within all of China. Back then, we conquered China in just 70 years. From the brink of collapse, we brought ourselves back and, in an even more impressive show of power, managed it in even less time. We must now prove our legitimacy."
  kha_beijing_title: "Restore Beijing"
  kha_beijing_desc: "The old capital, when the Great Khanate split off, Beijing was taken with it. Now, it resides in Han-Chinese hands. We cannot let this disgrace continue."
  kha_yangtze_title: "Control the Yangtze"
  kha_yantze_desc: "The Yangtze River is an important trade stream, formerly under our control. We should--no, must--take this land back from the despicable Chinese who have no good use for it. Looking back on our past actions, we probably should've just levelled all of Northern China and turned it into grazing land."
  kha_seize_empire_title: "Seize the Empire"
  kha_seize_empire_desc: "The Ming can hardly be called an empire, thus we shall strip them of the title. Our advance will be swift, and the Great Khanate shall rise once more."
  kha_oceans_title: "Empire of Two Oceans"
  kha_oceans_desc: "Upon our furthest extent, we heard tales of another ocean, lying west, beyond the endless stepped, and even beyond the Franks. We would do well to find this ocean and see it with our own eyes."
  kha_russia_title: "Ravage Russia"
  kha_russia_desc: "The Muscovites betrayed us and cannot be forgiven. We must invade immediately to teach them the most important lesson of all: the world is cyclical, and their destruction shall come once again."
  kha_korchin_title: "Subjugate Korchin"
  kha_korchin_desc: "The Mongol tribe of Korchin and surrounding lands used to be in union with the Mongol Empire. Now, they stand divided and helpless against Chinese aggression. We shall bestow mercy and reintegrate them."
  kha_manchus_title: "Overpower the Manchus"
  kha_manchus_desc: "Consisting of Mongols, the Manchus rightly belong under our protection. The day we cannot provide that protection is the day we fail as a nation."
  kha_neglect_title: "Shamanist Benign Neglect"
  kha_neglect_desc: "We need no state religion, nor standardized worship. Other nations may find use for these establishments, but in all honesty, Mongolia is better without them. We were known far and wide for our policy of tolerance during the glory days, which will repeat once more."
  kha_unite_tengri_title: "Unite the Shamanists"
  kha_unite_tengri_desc: "Beneath the infinite sky, known by many as Tengri, lies those who worship the blue expanse that provides all life in this world. We must unite the people who see this light for what it truly is."
