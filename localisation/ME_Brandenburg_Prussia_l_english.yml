 BRA_renaissance_desc: "Renaissance, a movement originating from Italy in the 15th century, has not passed by the marches. At the end of the 15th century, the margraves of Brandenburg have begun to pursue a state ruled by law and humanism. As a result, elector Joachim the First has founded Universita Viadrina in 1506. Having also strengthened the rights of the 'Kammergericht' ten years later and instituted the Constitutio Joachimica in 1527, elector Joachim I has established himself as the initiator of renaissance in Brandenburg."

 ME_Prussia_Events.1.d: "Following the ascension of his brother to the Electoral seat of Brandenburg, Albert was formally a margrave of Brandenburg, but chose to follow the ecclesiastical path after his studies at the university of Frankfurt.

 ME_Prussia_Events.24.d: "In the days of old, France and Holy Roman Empire were a single state ruled by the Francian Kings. Unfortunately, all things, good or bad, come to an end. The Treaty of Verdun has seen the Frankish Empire splinter into three states, two of which would later become France and the Holy Roman Empire. It is why, France, the western neighbour of the Holy Roman Empire, has, since time immemorial, been influencing the western princes. Their influence can not only be seen in the culture, but also in their 'patronage' of enforcing the 1648's Treaty of Westphalia. This influence is, more often than not, hampering the unification of the German Peoples. Fortunately, the rising state in Prussia has decided to put an end to the French influence and has finally abased the French, preventing them from further influencing the german cities."

Since then, it has undergone many changes in administration, centralization and army organization, oftentimes in vain. Despite these changes, the slow decay of the imperial power has not halted. The apparent state of weakness displayed by the Empire has only been reinforced by the glorious campaign lead by us against the forces of the Emperor. Having been humiliated by catastrophic losses, the imperial authority is but a shell of its former self. This proves once and for all, that the emperor is not fit for protecting the Germans. About time the german princes realized that only the Prussian crown may offer them certain independence."
 ME_Prussia_Events.25.d.2: "Holy Roman Empire is an entity that dates back almost a thousand years. Since then, it has undergone many changes in administration, centralization and army organization, oftentimes in vain. Despite these changes, the slow decay of the imperial power has not halted. Fortunately, the future of the Empire shines bright, for it is the new Emperor, [Root.Ruler.GetName] that shall decide the fate of the German People. No more shall our brethren tremble in fear of the imperial enemies!"
 ME_Prussia_Events.25.d.3: "Holy Roman Empire was an entity that dated back almost a thousand years. Since then, it has undergone many changes in administration, centralization and army organization, oftentimes in vain. Despite these changes, the slow decay of the imperial power has not halted. At last, the Holy Roman Empire is no more. Dismantled not just by foreign aggression, but also by internal strife, it finally met its end. As such, the German People remain splintered among many weak states that are prone to a quick  end by the hands of german enemies. It is high time Prussia took the initiative and became the defender of the German citizens."

Among his policies was the promotion of art within glassmaking. Under his rule, glass manufactures were constructed in Potsdam. Those would make crystal comparable to the one made in Italy and Bohemia, and one that would shine as an example of Baroque art."
