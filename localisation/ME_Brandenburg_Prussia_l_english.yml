 BRA_renaissance_title: "Arrival of Renaissance"
 BRA_renaissance_desc: "Renaissance, a movement originating from Italy in the 15th century, has not passed by the marches. At the end of the 15th century, the margraves of Brandenburg have begun to pursue a state ruled by law and humanism. As a result, elector Joachim the First has founded Universita Viadrina in 1506. Having also strengthened the rights of the 'Kammergericht' ten years later and instituted the Constitutio Joachimica in 1527, elector Joachim I has established himself as the initiator of renaissance in Brandenburg."
