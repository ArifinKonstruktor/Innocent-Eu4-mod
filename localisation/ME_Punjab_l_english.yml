 #Punjab Missions
 punjab_embrace_ik_onkar_title: "Ik Onkar?"
 punjab_embrace_ik_onkar_desc: "Through diplomacy and the fires of conflict, we have emerged as a firm political state in the northwest of the subcontinent that is surrounded by hostile powers. Sunni sultans, Hindu rajas, and perhaps even Buddhist leaders will try to stamp our faith out, but we know that their efforts will fail in the end. Our devotion to Guru Nanak's teachings will guide us through these harrowing times, but for now, we must decide on how we approach the various faiths that currently reside in Punjab."
 punjab_attraction_of_estates_title: "Recognize our Instiutions"
 punjab_attraction_of_estates_desc: "The various parts of Punjab's administration are scattered in where they are and what they do, but together they often exert force upon officials that force them to act not for the good of Punjabi people, but rather for the good of a few in the upper social classes of society. We need to recognize their strength and work to get each estate and social class of Punjab loyal to us over time so that we can pass effective laws and start to empower the Punjabi people and the Sikh faith."
 punjab_the_starting_misls_title: "Sikh Misls, Arise!"
 punjab_the_starting_misls_desc: "Punjab may seem to outsiders like a firm and rigid state where provinces/states cooperate most of the time under a central administration, but this is far from the truth for Punjab. We are much more akin to a confederacy of Punjabi and Sikh states united into one semi-cohesive whole. Internally, we are seeing the rise of these various Punjabi and Sikh states into Misls which wield various amounts of power depending on how large they become inside Punjab itself. Work toward centralizing these Misls and slowly doing away with a confederation-like system will take time and we must deal with how decentralized things are right now."
 OWNS_ALL_PUNJABI_PROVINCES_IN_ASIA: "§O[This.GetName] must own all provinces in India of Punjabi culture.§!"
 punjab_contact_the_nihang_title: "The Rising Sikh Warriors"
 punjab_contact_the_nihang_desc: "Sikhism has its foundations in a harsh environment, being less welcomed in various parts of the subcontinent as opposed to Islam, Hinduism and its traditions, or Buddhism and its sects. There are those who have taken Sikhism to heart though, and stand by with sword and shield at the ready in order to defend what they know as the great truth brought to us by Guru Nanak. These great warriors of the Sikh faith are scattered far and wide as of right now, but we can begin to call them toward our military over time."
 punjab_ninhangs_and_the_misls_title: "Nihangs and Misls"
 punjab_ninhangs_and_the_misls_desc: "As our military strength grows alongside the various Misls that make up Punjab, more and more nihangs (armed sikh warrior) are flocking to our land to serve in the forming army of the faithful. Whilst we must make room over time for these bold and effective warriors of Sikhism, we are very glad for their service and will continue to bring as many to Punjab as we can."
 punjab_akal_takht_sahib_title: "The First Takht"
 punjab_akal_takht_sahib_desc: "Sikhism is in need of a central place of spiritual and temporal authority. For too long it has survived without a place like this, but since Punjab has started to thrive and build up various parts of itself into bustling towns of commerce and growth, we are now capable of building up a true holy site. As luck would have it too, one of our great gurus has already laid helped gather people to help lay the foundation for this first center of the Sikh faith, and he is calling it 'Amritsar'. Alongside it's main temple complex, he has called for a place that can symbolize temporal justice and guidance, calling it the Akal Takht Sahib, or, the Eternal Throne. Perhaps now is the time we work with our guru and build up Amritsar?"

 #Punjab Mission Rewards#
 punjab_strength_of_the_start: "Spread of Sikh Teachings"
 desc_punjab_strength_of_the_start: "Guru Nanak's words ring clearly to our administration and to many Punjabi communities under us, though this does mean many Muslim and Hindu communities are going to become issues for us."
 punjab_tolerance_is_key: "Encouraged Sikh Debates"
 desc_punjab_tolerance_is_key: "Though we see there is divine truth in Sikh teachings, we must engage in more scholarly debates around theology and philosophy if we are to truly come to peace with the people of our land."
 punjab_suppression_of_sikhs: "Suppression of Sikhism"
 desc_punjab_suppression_of_sikhs: "Whatever teachings that 'Guru Nanak' thought was good for people is only going to serve as fodder for what should not be taught in Punjab. Now is the time to reinstate order and unity amongst Punjabi people whether they like it or not."
 punjab_confederated_misls: "Confederation of Misls"

 #Punjab Events#
 ME_Punjab_Events.1.a: "'There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim'"
 ME_Punjab_Events.1.b: "From the Khyber Pass toward the fertile plains near Lahore and Panipat, Punjabi people follow a variety of traditions at the local level. Teachings from the Bhakti tradition, Sunni and Shiite imams, sufi orders and their saints, and various other Hindu sects all call themselves home in a land where the relatively new religion that is Sikhism is rising up. Some in our administration want for it to be the religion of the Punjabi people, something to unify them into a strong and cohesive state against outside threats, but they have their detractors. Other officials advise to let Guru Nanak's words spread naturally and without firm missionary work; these officials see tolerance as the only way Punjab will be able to survive in the future. Depending on what we choose as of now, we will be helping shape our Sikhism is interpreted and understood by those inside and outside our Punjab."
 ME_Punjab_Events.1.c: "The Sikh faith is what is best for the Punjabi people."
 ME_Punjab_Events.1.d: "The teachings will radiate naturally through talks and debates."
 
 ME_Punjab_Events.2.a: "Formation of Misls"
 ME_Punjab_Events.2.b: "The political nature of Punjab is intertwined with the Sikh faith inherently, but with Sikhism being relatively new as compared to Islam, Hindu traditions, and Buddhist sects, it has been very hard for Punjab to organize things effectively into something akin to provinces or states working together underneath a strong administration. Power is quite decentralized in Punjab as it is but this decentralized nature does not mean we are without strength. Sikh warriors and Punjabi people are more than ready to defend what is theirs from outside forces, but this does not help the fact that we are shifting more toward a confederation of states working toward a common goal instead of a being a centralized state.\nPerhaps we can try to reverse this and enact new laws and legislation later on, consolidating the power of these various Sikh and Punjabi Misls, but as for now, politics inside Punjab are relatively stable in this decentralized manner."
 ME_Punjab_Events.2.c: "Deg Teg Fateh! Victory to Charity and Arms!"
 
 ME_Punjab_Events.3.a: "The Golden Temple & Akal Takht Sahib"
 ME_Punjab_Events.3.b: "The Sikh faith at its inception has had little in the way of a central place for religious pilgrimage, but time has gone on and the decades have brought forth to the Sikh faith a righteous and glorious place that can be called the center of the Sikh faith: the Golden Temple in Amritsar with the Akal Takhat Sahib (meaning Eternal Throne) integrated within it.\nThe foundation of the Golden Temple complex was laid by one of our greatest gurus and it has grown to be immensely popular as time has gone on, yet all Sikhs know that the Golden Temple itself symbolizes spiritual guidance, not corporeal judgement. Instead, the Akal Takht Sahib is what stands for justice in this realm and it is a central place where many in our faith seek guidance from (aside from other learned Sikhs).\nThe Jathedar of the Akal Takht Sahib must be elected as of now as the position is currently vacant; the previous Jathedar has passed away and now we must see which candidates are viable to help lead our faith."
 ME_Punjab_Events.3.c: "The studious and diligent candidate is a fine pick."
 ME_Punjab_Events.3.d: "The most well spoken candidate will help us most."
 ME_Punjab_Events.3.e: "The one with great martial skill can help guide us."
