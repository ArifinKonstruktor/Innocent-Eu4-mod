 ME_Ayutthaya_Events.2.d: "When the brother of Thau Choi, Tilokkarat, seized the throne of Lan Na in 1441 from his father, Thau Choi decided to start a rebellion and seek support from our Kingdom. Up until now, we have already sent several military invasions in support of Thau Choi's rebellion, but none have proven to be successful. And as of now, the conflict has become a stalemate between Thau Choi's loyalists and the King Tilokkarat's forces. We can of course, send our full military support and declare a war in support of Thau Choi and perhaps gain a new vassal for our Kingdom."
